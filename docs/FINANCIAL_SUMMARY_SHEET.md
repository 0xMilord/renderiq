## Appendix: Calculation Formulas

### Image Profit Calculation:
```
API Cost (USD) × Conversion Rate (100) = API Cost (INR)
Revenue = Credits Charged × Credit Price (₹5)
Profit = Revenue - API Cost (INR)
Margin = (Profit ÷ Revenue) × 100
```

### Video Profit Calculation:
```
API Cost (USD/sec) × Conversion Rate (100) = API Cost (INR/sec)
Credits/sec = (API Cost × 2 markup × 100) ÷ 5
Revenue = Credits × Credit Price (₹5)
Profit = Revenue - API Cost (INR)
Margin = (Profit ÷ Revenue) × 100
```
