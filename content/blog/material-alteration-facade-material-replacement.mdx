# Material Alteration Tool: Facade Material Replacement for Building Exteriors

Brick? Glass? Concrete? Wood? The facade material changes the entire building's character. But testing materials means re-rendering the whole exterior, hoping the lighting stays consistent, hoping the proportions look right.

This tool swaps facade materials without touching anything else. Same building, different skin.

## Material Testing Without the Hassle

Upload your exterior render. Pick a new material: brick, glass, concrete, metal, wood, stone, or composite. Choose a finish: matte for natural look, glossy for modern, textured for character, satin for balance.

The AI finds the facade surfaces, replaces the materials, keeps the structure intact, preserves the lighting and shadows. The building looks real, just wearing different materials. Test options quickly, compare results, make decisions without re-rendering the whole project.

## Available Materials

### Traditional Materials

- **Brick**: Various brick types and patterns
- **Stone**: Natural stone finishes and textures
- **Wood**: Wood cladding and finishes

### Modern Materials

- **Glass**: Various glass types and finishes
- **Metal**: Metal panels and finishes
- **Concrete**: Concrete textures and finishes
- **Composite**: Composite material panels

## Finish Options

### Matte Finish

Non-reflective surface:

- Natural material appearance
- Subtle texture
- Classic aesthetic
- Traditional character

### Glossy Finish

Reflective, polished surface:

- High reflectivity
- Modern appearance
- Premium aesthetic
- Contemporary character

### Textured Finish

Surface texture emphasis:

- Enhanced texture visibility
- Material character
- Tactile appearance
- Natural material feel

### Satin Finish

Semi-reflective surface:

- Balanced reflectivity
- Versatile appearance
- Professional aesthetic
- Flexible character

## Key Features

## Step-by-Step Guide

### Step 1: Prepare Your Render

1. Use exterior render with clear facade visibility
2. Ensure building surfaces are visible
3. Use high-quality input (minimum 1920x1080)
4. Good lighting for accurate material appearance

### Step 2: Upload to Tool

1. Navigate to the [Material Alteration tool](/apps/material-alteration)
2. Upload your exterior render
3. The AI will identify facade surfaces

### Step 3: Select Material

Choose replacement material:

- Brick, glass, concrete, metal, wood, stone, or composite
- Consider building type and context
- Match design intent
- Test multiple materials

### Step 4: Choose Finish

Select surface finish:

- **Matte**: Natural, non-reflective
- **Glossy**: Reflective, polished
- **Textured**: Enhanced texture
- **Satin**: Semi-reflective

### Step 5: Generate Modified Render

Click generate and wait 30-60 seconds. The tool will:

- Identify facade surfaces
- Apply new material
- Add selected finish
- Maintain structure and lighting

### Step 6: Review and Compare

Review the material change:

- Check material appearance
- Verify structural preservation
- Compare with original
- Generate variations if needed

## Best Practices

### Material Selection

- Choose appropriate materials for building type
- Consider regional context
- Match design style
- Test multiple options

### Finish Selection

- Match finish to material type
- Consider building character
- Evaluate finish effect
- Test different finishes

### Input Quality

- Use high-quality exterior renders
- Ensure clear facade visibility
- Good lighting conditions
- Appropriate resolution

### Comparison Process

- Compare multiple material options
- Evaluate in context
- Consider overall design
- Make informed decisions

## Technical Specifications

- **Input**: Single exterior render (JPG, PNG, WebP)
- **Output**: Render with modified facade materials
- **Processing Time**: 30-60 seconds
- **Available Materials**: Brick, glass, concrete, metal, wood, stone, composite
- **Finish Options**: Matte, glossy, textured, satin
