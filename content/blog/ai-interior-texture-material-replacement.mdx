# Change Texture Tool: AI Material Replacement for Interior Spaces

That render looks great. But what if the hardwood floor was tile? What if the wall was brick instead of drywall? What if you want to test five different material options before making a decision?

Re-rendering means going back to your 3D software, changing materials, waiting for renders, hoping the lighting matches. Or you could just replace the materials in the existing render.

## Material Swapping, Done Right

Upload your render. Tell it what material you want (wood, stone, metal, tile, concrete, marble, plaster, fabric). Pick the intensity—subtle change that keeps the character, or complete replacement.

The AI finds the surfaces, replaces the materials, keeps the lighting right, maintains shadows and reflections. The space looks real, just with different materials. Test options fast, compare results, make decisions without re-rendering everything.

## Material Options

Wood, stone, metal, tile, concrete, marble, plaster, fabric. Natural materials or manufactured—all available. Pick the intensity: subtle keeps character, medium balances, strong completely transforms.

Lighting stays accurate. Shadows, reflections, light direction—all preserved. The materials change, but the space still looks real.

### Step 1: Prepare Your Render

1. Use interior render with clear material visibility
2. Ensure surfaces to modify are visible
3. Use high-quality input (minimum 1920x1080)
4. Good lighting for accurate material appearance

### Step 2: Upload to Tool

1. Navigate to the [Change Texture tool](/apps/ai-interior-texture-material-replacement)
2. Upload your interior render
3. The AI will identify surfaces and materials

### Step 3: Select Material

Choose replacement material:

- Wood, stone, metal, fabric
- Concrete, marble, tile, plaster
- Consider material appropriateness
- Match design intent

### Step 4: Set Intensity

Adjust change strength:

- **Subtle**: Light modification
- **Medium**: Balanced change
- **Strong**: Complete transformation

### Step 5: Generate Modified Render

Click generate and wait 30-60 seconds. The tool will:

- Identify target surfaces
- Apply new material texture
- Maintain lighting conditions
- Preserve spatial relationships

### Step 6: Review and Compare

Review the material change:

- Check material appearance
- Verify lighting preservation
- Compare with original
- Generate variations if needed

## Best Practices

### Material Selection

- Choose appropriate materials for surfaces
- Consider material compatibility
- Match design style and intent
- Test multiple options

### Intensity Adjustment

- Start with medium intensity
- Adjust based on desired effect
- Compare subtle vs. strong
- Balance change and realism

### Input Quality

- Use high-quality renders
- Ensure good lighting
- Clear material visibility
- Appropriate resolution

### Comparison Process

- Compare multiple material options
- Evaluate in context
- Consider overall design
- Make informed decisions

## Technical Specifications

- **Input**: Single interior render (JPG, PNG, WebP)
- **Output**: Render with modified materials
- **Processing Time**: 30-60 seconds
- **Available Materials**: Wood, stone, metal, fabric, concrete, marble, tile, plaster
- **Intensity Levels**: Subtle, medium, strong
