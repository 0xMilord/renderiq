# How to Render a Floor Plan Using AI

Floor plans are essential, but clients can't visualize them. AI rendering fixes that—no 3D modeling required.

## Why Render Floor Plans?

**The Problem:**
```text
Client sees: Lines and labels
Client needs: "Oh, I get it now!"
```

**The Solution:**
```text
Upload plan → Describe vision → Get render
Time: 2 minutes
Result: Client actually understands your design
```

### Use Cases

- **Client presentations**: Show spaces, not just lines
- **Marketing materials**: Make listings more appealing
- **Sales presentations**: Help buyers visualize
- **Design development**: See concepts before modeling

## Step-by-Step Process

### Step 1: Prepare Your Floor Plan

**Best Practices:**
```text
✓ High resolution (minimum 300 DPI)
✓ Clear linework (no fuzzy lines)
✓ Proper scale indication
✓ Room labels (helpful but optional)
✓ Furniture layout (if applicable)
```

**File Formats:**
- JPG, PNG, WebP (high resolution)
- PDF (vector preferred)

**What to avoid:**
- Low resolution images
- Cluttered annotations
- Unclear linework

### Step 2: Create Project and Upload

```text
1. Log into Renderiq (free tier available)
2. Navigate to /render or /dashboard/projects
3. Create project: "Smith Residence Floor Plans"
4. Upload floor plan in unified chat interface
   ├─ Drag & drop
   └─ Or click to upload
5. Supported: JPG, PNG, WebP
```

### Step 3: Describe Your Vision

Use natural language in the chat interface:

**Style Examples:**
```text
"Convert this floor plan into a modern minimalist 
interior visualization with light wood floors and white walls"

"Render as a luxury residential space with high-end 
finishes and contemporary furniture"

"Create a professional office layout visualization 
showing collaborative workspaces"

"Transform into a cozy residential interior with 
warm materials and natural lighting"
```

**Quality Settings:**
```text
Standard (1 credit): Quick iterations
High (2 credits): Client presentations
Ultra (3 credits): Final deliverables
```

**Aspect Ratios:**
```text
Match your plan's proportions or choose:
├─ 16:9 (widescreen)
├─ 9:16 (portrait)
├─ 1:1 (square)
├─ 4:3 (traditional)
└─ 21:9 (ultra-wide)
```

### Step 4: Generate and Iterate

**Initial Generation:**
```text
1. Click generate or press Enter
2. Wait 30-60 seconds
3. Review for accuracy
4. Check spatial relationships
```

**Building on Previous Renders:**
```text
v1: Base render
v2: "Make kitchen more modern" → @v1
v3: "Add plants to living room" → @v2
v4: "Refine lighting" → @v3

All tracked automatically in render chain
```

**Refinement Examples:**
```text
"Adjust specific room" → @latest
"Modify materials" → @latest
"Change lighting" → @latest
"Generate variation" → @v1
```

### Step 5: Export

```text
HD (1920x1080): Free tier, perfect for web/presentations
4K (3840x2160): Pro tier, ideal for print/large displays
```

## Tips for Best Results

### 1. Start with Quality Plans

```text
Good plan = Good render
Bad plan = Disappointing render
```

Use vector formats when possible. Clear, defined lines produce better results.

### 2. Be Specific in Prompts

**Bad:**
```text
"Make it look nice"
```

**Good:**
```text
"Modern Scandinavian interior with light oak floors, 
white walls, and minimalist furniture"
```

### 3. Use Reference Images

Upload material samples or style references:

```text
Upload: Wood sample image
Prompt: "Apply this wood texture to floors" → @latest
Result: Consistent material application
```

### 4. Iterate and Compare

Generate multiple options:

```text
Option A: Modern minimalist
Option B: Traditional elegant
Option C: Industrial loft

Compare side-by-side, pick the winner
```

## Common Use Cases

### Residential Design

**New Construction:**
```text
Upload: Floor plan
Generate: "Modern family home interior"
Result: Client sees their future home
```

**Renovations:**
```text
Upload: Existing floor plan
Generate: "Updated kitchen and living area"
Result: Client visualizes changes
```

### Commercial Projects

**Office Layouts:**
```text
Upload: Office floor plan
Generate: "Collaborative workspace with modern furniture"
Result: Client understands workspace design
```

**Retail Spaces:**
```text
Upload: Store layout
Generate: "Modern retail store with product displays"
Result: Visualize store before build-out
```

### Real Estate

**Property Listings:**
```text
Upload: Floor plan
Generate: "Stylish residential interior"
Result: Enhanced marketing materials
```

## Advanced Techniques

### Multi-Level Rendering

For multi-story buildings:

```text
1. Render each floor separately
2. Use consistent style across levels
3. Combine in presentation software
4. Create cohesive visual story
```

### Material Specification

Be specific about materials:

```text
Flooring: "Hardwood", "Tile", "Carpet", "Concrete"
Walls: "Painted", "Wallpaper", "Exposed brick"
Ceilings: "Exposed beams", "Suspended", "Vaulted"
```

### Lighting Design

Control lighting conditions:

```text
"Bright natural daylight"
"Warm evening lighting"
"Professional office lighting"
"Cozy residential ambiance"
```

## Fast Workflow

```text
Create project: 10 seconds
Upload floor plan: 10 seconds
Write prompt: 10 seconds
Generate render: 30-60 seconds
Iterate: 1-2 minutes per refinement
Export: Instant

Total: Under 5 minutes for professional results
```
