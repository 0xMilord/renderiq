# How to Render a Floor Plan Using AI (Step-by-Step)

Floor plans are the foundation of architectural design, but they can be difficult for clients to visualize. Converting floor plans into rendered visuals helps clients understand spatial relationships, flow, and design intent. With AI, this process is now faster and more accessible than ever.

## Why Render Floor Plans?

### Client Communication

Clients often struggle to visualize spaces from 2D plans. Rendered floor plans help them:
- Understand spatial relationships
- Visualize furniture placement
- See material and color choices
- Grasp the overall design concept

### Marketing and Presentations

Rendered floor plans are powerful for:
- Sales presentations
- Marketing materials
- Website listings
- Social media content

## Step-by-Step Process

### Step 1: Prepare Your Floor Plan

Start with a clean, clear floor plan:

**Best Practices:**
- High resolution (minimum 300 DPI)
- Clear linework (no fuzzy or pixelated lines)
- Proper scale indication
- Room labels (optional but helpful)
- Furniture layout (if applicable)

**File Formats:**
- PDF (vector preferred)
- PNG or JPG (high resolution)
- CAD exports (DXF, DWG)

### Step 2: Create a Project and Upload

1. Log into your Renderiq account (free tier available)
2. Navigate to `/render` or `/dashboard/projects`
3. Create a new project (e.g., "Smith Residence Floor Plans")
4. In the unified chat interface, upload your floor plan image
   - Drag and drop or click to upload
   - Supported formats: JPG, PNG, WebP, PDF
5. Projects automatically create render chains to track iterations

### Step 3: Describe Your Vision

Use Renderiq's conversational interface to describe what you want:

**Style Examples:**
- "Convert this floor plan into a modern minimalist interior visualization with light wood floors and white walls"
- "Render as a luxury residential space with high-end finishes and contemporary furniture"
- "Create a professional office layout visualization showing collaborative workspaces"
- "Transform into a cozy residential interior with warm materials and natural lighting"

**Quality Options:**
- Standard (1 credit): Quick iterations
- High (2 credits): Client presentations
- Ultra (3 credits): Final deliverables

**Aspect Ratios:**
- Match your plan's proportions or choose 16:9, 9:16, 1:1, 4:3, or 21:9

### Step 4: Add Context with Prompts

Enhance your render with descriptive prompts:

**Examples:**
- "Modern minimalist interior with light wood floors and white walls"
- "Luxury residential space with high-end finishes"
- "Contemporary office layout with collaborative workspaces"
- "Cozy residential interior with warm materials"

### Step 4: Generate and Iterate with Render Chains

**Initial Generation:**
- Click generate or press Enter
- Render completes in 30-60 seconds using Google Gemini 3 Pro
- Review for accuracy and style
- Check spatial relationships

**Building on Previous Renders:**
- Use @v1, @v2, or @latest to reference earlier versions
- Continue the conversation to refine specific areas
- Example: "Make the kitchen more modern, referencing @latest"
- All iterations are tracked in your render chain automatically

**Refinement Options:**
- Adjust specific rooms or areas through conversation
- Modify materials and colors with descriptive prompts
- Change lighting conditions naturally
- Generate variations by referencing previous renders

### Step 5: Export Your Render

Choose your export resolution:
- **HD (1920x1080)**: Included in free tier, perfect for web and presentations
- **4K (3840x2160)**: Pro tier feature, ideal for print and high-quality displays

## Tips for Best Results

### 1. Start with Quality Plans

The better your input, the better your output:
- Use vector formats when possible
- Ensure clear, defined lines
- Include scale references
- Remove unnecessary annotations

### 2. Be Specific in Prompts

Instead of: "Make it look nice"
Use: "Modern Scandinavian interior with light oak floors, white walls, and minimalist furniture"

### 3. Use Reference Images

Upload reference images to guide:
- Material choices
- Color palettes
- Style direction
- Furniture styles

### 4. Iterate and Compare

Generate multiple options to:
- Explore different styles
- Compare material choices
- Test color schemes
- Find the best representation

## Common Use Cases

### Residential Design

- **New construction**: Show clients how their home will look
- **Renovations**: Visualize changes to existing layouts
- **Interior design**: Demonstrate furniture and decor placement
- **Space planning**: Optimize room layouts

### Commercial Projects

- **Office layouts**: Show workspace configurations
- **Retail spaces**: Visualize store layouts
- **Restaurants**: Demonstrate dining arrangements
- **Healthcare**: Show patient flow and spaces

### Real Estate

- **Property listings**: Enhance marketing materials
- **Development proposals**: Show future layouts
- **Sales presentations**: Help buyers visualize spaces

## Advanced Techniques

### Multi-Level Rendering

For multi-story buildings:
1. Render each floor separately
2. Use consistent style across levels
3. Combine in presentation software
4. Create a cohesive visual story

### Material Specification

Specify materials in your prompts:
- Flooring: "Hardwood", "Tile", "Carpet", "Concrete"
- Walls: "Painted", "Wallpaper", "Exposed brick", "Wood paneling"
- Ceilings: "Exposed beams", "Suspended", "Vaulted"

### Lighting Design

Control lighting conditions:
- "Bright natural daylight"
- "Warm evening lighting"
- "Professional office lighting"
- "Cozy residential ambiance"
