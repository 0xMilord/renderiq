# How to Create Consistent Design Options Using AI

Creating design variations traditionally requires rebuilding models. AI makes this fast and easy.

## The Traditional Problem

### Time-Consuming Process

- Rebuild models for each option
- Reapply materials
- Reset lighting
- Re-render each variation

**Time: Hours per option**

## How AI Solves This

### Fast Variation Generation

- Start with one base render
- Generate multiple variations
- Compare options instantly
- Refine chosen direction

**Time: Minutes for multiple options**

## Use Cases

### Material Options

- Test different materials
- Compare color schemes
- Explore finishes
- Present options to clients

### Lighting Variations

- Different times of day
- Various lighting styles
- Mood exploration
- Presentation options

### Layout Studies

- Space arrangement options
- Furniture placement
- Flow variations
- Functional testing

## Best Practices

1. **Start with quality base**: Good input = good variations
2. **Be specific**: Describe what should change
3. **Use references**: Guide material choices
4. **Compare systematically**: Review options side-by-side

## How Renderiq Creates Consistent Options

### Render Chains for Option Tracking

- Start with one base render
- Generate variations using @v1, @v2, @latest references
- Track all options in render chains
- Compare options side-by-side
- Build on chosen direction

### Unified Chat Interface

- Natural language prompts for variations
- Conversational refinement workflow
- Version references for consistency
- Real-time preview of options

### Project Organization

- Create separate projects for different option sets
- Organize by client, concept, or phase
- Easy access to all variations
- Gallery integration for sharing

## Step-by-Step: Creating Design Options

### Step 1: Create Base Render

1. Upload your sketch, photo, or model snapshot
2. Generate initial render using unified chat interface
3. Review for accuracy and style
4. This becomes your base (@v1)

### Step 2: Generate Variations

Use render chains to create options:
- **Material options**: "Same design but with dark wood instead of light wood, referencing @v1"
- **Lighting variations**: "Same space but with warm evening lighting, referencing @latest"
- **Layout studies**: "Same room but with furniture arranged differently, referencing @v1"

### Step 3: Compare and Refine

- Review all options in render chain
- Compare side-by-side
- Refine chosen direction
- Export selected options
