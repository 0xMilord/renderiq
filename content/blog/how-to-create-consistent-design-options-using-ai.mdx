# How to Create Consistent Design Options Using AI

Creating design variations traditionally means rebuilding models, reapplying materials, and re-rendering everything. AI makes this obsolete.

## The Old Way vs. The New Way

### Traditional Workflow (The Pain)

```text
Option 1: Modern Materials
├─ Rebuild model
├─ Apply new materials
├─ Reset lighting
└─ Render (2-4 hours)

Option 2: Traditional Materials
├─ Rebuild model (again)
├─ Apply different materials
├─ Reset lighting (again)
└─ Render (2-4 hours)

Total: 4-8 hours for 2 options
```

### AI Workflow (The Fast Way)

```text
Base Render: Initial concept (30-60 seconds)

Option 1: "Change to modern materials" → @latest
└─ Generate (30-60 seconds)

Option 2: "Use traditional materials instead" → @latest
└─ Generate (30-60 seconds)

Total: 2-3 minutes for 2 options
```

## Use Cases That Actually Matter

### Material Options

**The Scenario:** Client wants to see wood vs. concrete vs. glass.

**The Solution:**
```text
v1: Base render with initial materials
v2: "Replace with warm wood finishes" → @v1
v3: "Use raw concrete instead" → @v1
v4: "Try glass and steel" → @v1

Result: 3 material options, all consistent with base design
```

### Lighting Variations

**The Scenario:** Show the space at different times of day.

**The Solution:**
```text
v1: Base render (daylight)
v2: "Golden hour lighting, warm sunset" → @v1
v3: "Night scene with interior lights" → @v1
v4: "Overcast day, soft diffused light" → @v1

Result: Same space, 4 different moods
```

### Layout Studies

**The Scenario:** Test different furniture arrangements.

**The Solution:**
```text
v1: Base layout
v2: "Open floor plan, remove partition" → @v1
v3: "Add kitchen island, rearrange seating" → @v1
v4: "Minimalist, fewer pieces" → @v1

Result: Same room, 4 layout options
```

## How Renderiq Keeps Options Consistent

### Render Chains = Version Control

Every option is tracked in a chain:

```text
Project: "Client-A-Living-Room"
└─ Chain: "Material Options"
    ├─ v1: Base (warm wood)
    ├─ v2: Modern (concrete + steel)
    ├─ v3: Traditional (ornate details)
    └─ v4: Minimalist (white + natural)
```

All options reference the same base, maintaining consistency.

### Version References

Use `@v1`, `@v2`, or `@latest` to build on previous renders:

```text
Prompt: "Change materials to modern concrete" → @v1
Result: Same layout, different materials

Prompt: "Make it more traditional" → @v1
Result: Same layout, traditional style

Both reference v1, so they stay consistent
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Start with a Strong Base

```text
Good base = Good variations
Bad base = Inconsistent mess
```

Spend time on your first render. Everything else builds from it.

### 2. Be Specific About What Changes

**Bad:**
```text
"Make it different"
```

**Good:**
```text
"Change wall materials to exposed brick, 
keep furniture layout the same"
```

### 3. Use Reference Images

Upload material samples or style references to guide variations:

```text
Upload: Concrete sample image
Prompt: "Apply this concrete texture to walls" → @latest
Result: Consistent material application
```

### 4. Compare Side-by-Side

Use render chains to view all options together:

```text
Gallery View:
├─ v1: Base
├─ v2: Option A
├─ v3: Option B
└─ v4: Option C

Compare instantly, pick the winner
```

## Real-World Example: Client Presentation

**The Brief:** Show 3 material options for a modern office.

**The Workflow:**
```text
1. Create project: "Office-Material-Options"
2. Upload base sketch
3. Generate v1: "Modern office, neutral materials" (60s)
4. Generate v2: "Same layout, warm wood accents" → @v1 (60s)
5. Generate v3: "Same layout, industrial concrete" → @v1 (60s)
6. Export all 3 in HD
7. Present to client

Total time: 3 minutes
Client sees: 3 consistent options
You saved: 6-12 hours of manual work
```

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Mistake 1: Not Using Version References

**Wrong:**
```text
v1: Base render
v2: New render (no reference)
v3: Another new render (no reference)

Result: Inconsistent options
```

**Right:**
```text
v1: Base render
v2: "Change materials" → @v1
v3: "Different materials" → @v1

Result: Consistent options
```

### Mistake 2: Changing Too Much at Once

**Wrong:**
```text
"Change materials, lighting, layout, and style"
```

**Right:**
```text
"Change only the wall materials to brick"
```

One change at a time = better consistency.

## Conclusion

Creating design options doesn't have to mean rebuilding everything. Renderiq's render chains let you generate consistent variations in minutes, not hours.

**Key Advantages:**
- Generate options in minutes, not hours
- Maintain consistency with version references
- Track all options in render chains
- Compare side-by-side instantly
- Build on chosen direction easily

## People Also Ask

### How do I create consistent design variations?
Start with a strong base render, then use version references (`@v1`, `@latest`) to generate variations. Each option references the same base, maintaining consistency across all variations.

### Can AI maintain consistency across options?
Yes! Renderiq's render chains track all options and maintain consistency by referencing the same base render. Use version references to ensure all variations stay aligned with your original design.

### How fast can I generate design options?
With Renderiq, you can generate multiple design options in 2-3 minutes. Each variation takes 30-60 seconds, and all options are tracked automatically in render chains.
