# Best AI Tool for Interior Design Renders

Interior designers need AI tools that understand spatial relationships, material properties, and lighting principles. Most generic AI tools fail at interior rendering because they don't understand these fundamentals.

## Why Generic Tools Fail

Generic AI tools struggle with:
- **Proportional accuracy**: Distort room dimensions
- **Material logic**: Apply materials incorrectly
- **Lighting consistency**: Create impossible lighting
- **Spatial relationships**: Don't understand room layouts

## How Renderiq Solves This

### Interior-Focused AI

Renderiq understands:
- **Room proportions**: Maintains accurate dimensions
- **Material properties**: Applies materials logically
- **Lighting principles**: Creates realistic lighting
- **Spatial relationships**: Understands layouts

### Fast Workflow with Unified Chat Interface

- **Create project**: 10 seconds
- **Upload sketch or photo**: 10 seconds (drag & drop in chat)
- **Write prompt**: 30 seconds
- **Generate render**: 30-60 seconds (using Google Gemini 3 Pro)
- **Iterate with render chains**: 1-2 minutes per refinement
- **Export**: Instant download

**Total time: Under 5 minutes** for professional interior renders

## Use Cases

### Design Development

- **Concept visualization**: See ideas quickly
- **Material selection**: Test different materials
- **Color exploration**: Try color schemes
- **Layout testing**: Visualize arrangements

### Client Presentations

- **Design proposals**: Show concepts clearly
- **Option comparison**: Present multiple choices
- **Material selection**: Demonstrate options
- **Final presentations**: Professional visuals

## Step-by-Step: Interior Rendering Workflow

### Step 1: Create a Project

1. Log into Renderiq (free tier available)
2. Navigate to `/render` or `/dashboard/projects`
3. Create a new project (e.g., "Modern Living Room Design")
4. Projects automatically create render chains

### Step 2: Upload and Describe

In the unified chat interface:
- Upload your sketch, photo, or floor plan
- Describe your vision: "Modern minimalist living room with light oak floors, white walls, and contemporary furniture"
- Specify materials: "Natural wood, white marble, soft textiles"
- Set quality: Standard (1 credit), High (2 credits), or Ultra (3 credits)

### Step 3: Generate and Iterate

- Click generate or press Enter
- Render completes in 30-60 seconds
- Use @v1, @v2, or @latest to reference and refine
- Build iterations in your render chain
- Export in HD (free tier) or 4K (Pro tier)

## Best Practices

1. **Start with clear inputs**: Good sketches or photos produce better renders
2. **Be specific in prompts**: Describe materials, colors, and styles in detail
3. **Use reference images**: Guide material choices and style direction
4. **Leverage render chains**: Build on previous renders using version references
5. **Organize with projects**: Create separate projects for different clients or concepts
6. **Iterate efficiently**: Use Standard quality for tests, High/Ultra for finals
