# HD & 4K Export With Renderiq: When To Use Each Output

Resolution choice matters. Here's the simple guide to picking the right one.

## The Quick Answer

```text
HD (1920x1080): Digital use, presentations, web
4K (3840x2160): Print, large displays, final deliverables
```

## HD: The Digital Standard

### When to Use HD

**Perfect for:**
- Web presentations (Zoom, Teams, Google Slides)
- Email attachments (reasonable file size)
- Social media posts
- Online portfolios
- Quick client previews
- Internal reviews

**Specs:**
```text
Resolution: 1920x1080
File size: ~2-5 MB (reasonable)
Quality: Excellent for screens
Availability: Free tier included
```

### HD Use Cases

**Client Presentation:**
```text
Scenario: Presenting via Zoom
Choice: HD export
Reason: Perfect for screen sharing, fast to load
Result: Smooth presentation, no lag
```

**Portfolio Website:**
```text
Scenario: Building online portfolio
Choice: HD export
Reason: Fast loading, looks great on screens
Result: Professional portfolio, good UX
```

## 4K: The Print Standard

### When to Use 4K

**Perfect for:**
- Print materials (brochures, posters, boards)
- Large format displays (trade shows, presentations)
- High-quality presentations (final client meetings)
- Professional portfolios (print versions)
- Marketing materials (billboards, signage)

**Specs:**
```text
Resolution: 3840x2160
File size: ~10-20 MB (larger)
Quality: Print-ready, professional
Availability: Pro tier required
```

### 4K Use Cases

**Print Materials:**
```text
Scenario: Creating presentation boards
Choice: 4K export
Reason: Print quality, sharp at large sizes
Result: Professional printed materials
```

**Large Display:**
```text
Scenario: Trade show presentation
Choice: 4K export
Reason: Looks sharp on large screens
Result: Impressive display quality
```

## The Decision Matrix

```text
Use HD if:
├─ Presenting on screens
├─ Sharing digitally
├─ Web/email use
├─ Quick previews
└─ Free tier user

Use 4K if:
├─ Printing materials
├─ Large format displays
├─ Final deliverables
├─ Professional portfolios
└─ Pro tier user
```

## Renderiq Export Workflow

### Exporting from Chat Interface

```text
1. Generate render (30-60 seconds)
2. Click render to view full size
3. Click "Download" button
4. Choose resolution:
   ├─ HD (free tier)
   └─ 4K (Pro tier)
5. Download starts immediately
```

### Exporting Multiple Renders

```text
1. Go to project gallery
2. Select renders to export
3. Choose resolution (HD or 4K)
4. Batch download
5. All exports in one go
```

## File Size Comparison

```text
HD Export:
├─ Typical size: 2-5 MB
├─ Email: ✅ Easy to send
├─ Web: ✅ Fast loading
└─ Storage: ✅ Efficient

4K Export:
├─ Typical size: 10-20 MB
├─ Email: ⚠️ May need compression
├─ Web: ⚠️ Slower loading
└─ Storage: ⚠️ More space needed
```

## Quality Comparison

**On Screens:**
```text
HD: Looks perfect (most screens are 1080p)
4K: Looks perfect (but overkill for most screens)
```

**In Print:**
```text
HD: Good for small prints (8x10")
4K: Required for large prints (24x36" or larger)
```

## Pro Tips

### Tip 1: Start with HD, Upgrade When Needed

```text
Workflow:
├─ Generate render
├─ Export HD (free tier)
├─ Review and refine
└─ Export 4K (Pro tier) for final
```

### Tip 2: Use HD for Iterations

```text
Strategy:
├─ Iterations: HD exports (fast, efficient)
├─ Final version: 4K export (quality)
└─ Result: Save time and storage
```

### Tip 3: Know Your Output

```text
Before exporting, ask:
├─ Where will this be used?
├─ Screen or print?
├─ What size?
└─ Then choose resolution
```
