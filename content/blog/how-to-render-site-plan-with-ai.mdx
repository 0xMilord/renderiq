# How to Render a Site Plan With AI (Instant Workflow)

Site plans are essential for planning presentations, but they can be difficult for stakeholders to understand. Converting site plans into rendered visuals helps communicate design intent, spatial relationships, and project scope more effectively.

## Why Render Site Plans?

Site plan renders help:
- **Communicate design intent** to clients and stakeholders
- **Visualize masterplans** and large-scale projects
- **Present zoning proposals** clearly
- **Show landscape layouts** effectively
- **Demonstrate project scope** visually

## Step-by-Step Workflow

### Step 1: Prepare Your Site Plan

Start with a clean, clear site plan:
- High resolution (minimum 300 DPI)
- Clear linework and labels
- Proper scale indication
- Good contrast

### Step 2: Create a Project in Renderiq

1. Log into Renderiq (free tier available)
2. Navigate to `/render` or `/dashboard/projects`
3. Create a new project (e.g., "Downtown Masterplan")
4. Upload your site plan in the unified chat interface
   - Drag and drop or click to upload
   - Supported formats: JPG, PNG, WebP, PDF

### Step 3: Describe Your Vision

Use natural language in the chat interface:

**Style Examples:**
- "Convert this site plan into a professional planning visualization with clear building footprints and green spaces"
- "Render as a landscape-focused masterplan emphasizing parks and open spaces"
- "Create an urban context visualization showing the built environment and street layout"
- "Transform into a conceptual masterplan with artistic interpretation"

**Quality Settings:**
- Standard (1 credit): Quick iterations
- High (2 credits): Client presentations
- Ultra (3 credits): Final deliverables

### Step 4: Generate and Iterate

- Click generate or press Enter
- Render completes in 30-60 seconds using Google Gemini 3 Pro
- Review for accuracy and style
- Use @v1, @v2, or @latest to reference and refine
- Build iterations in your render chain
- Export in HD (free tier) or 4K (Pro tier)

## Use Cases

- Masterplan presentations
- Zoning applications
- Landscape design
- Development proposals
- Community presentations

## Best Practices

1. **Start with quality plans**: High resolution, clear linework, proper scale
2. **Be specific in prompts**: Describe the style, context, and focus areas
3. **Use render chains**: Build on previous renders with version references
4. **Organize with projects**: Create separate projects for different masterplans
5. **Iterate efficiently**: Use Standard quality for tests, High/Ultra for finals

## Common Questions

**Q: Can I render multiple site plan variations?**
A: Yes! Use render chains to create multiple iterations. Each variation is tracked automatically.

**Q: What resolution should I use?**
A: HD (1920x1080) is included in free tier and perfect for presentations. 4K (3840x2160) is available on Pro tier for print materials.

**Q: Can I combine multiple site plans?**
A: Render each plan separately, then combine them in your presentation software. Use consistent styles across plans.

**Q: How accurate are the renders?**
A: Renderiq maintains spatial relationships and proportions from your original plan while adding realistic context and materials.
