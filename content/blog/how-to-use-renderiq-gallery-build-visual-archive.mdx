# How to Use Renderiq's Gallery to Build a Visual Archive

Let's be honest: most AEC teams have renders scattered across emails, Slack threads, and random folders. Renderiq's gallery fixes that chaos by giving you one organized place for everything.

## Why Visual Archives Matter

**The Problem:** Finding that render from last month's client meeting takes 20 minutes of digging through folders.

**The Solution:** A gallery that automatically organizes everything by project, tracks versions, and lets you search instantly.

### Team Benefits

- **Easy access**: Find renders in seconds, not minutes
- **Organization**: Everything grouped by project automatically
- **Reference library**: Reuse successful approaches across projects
- **Client materials**: Quick access to presentation-ready visuals

## How Renderiq Gallery Works

### Automatic Organization

The gallery isn't just a folder—it's smart. Every render you create is automatically:

```text
✓ Tagged with project name
✓ Linked to render chain (if applicable)
✓ Timestamped for easy sorting
✓ Accessible via search
```

### Public vs Private

**Public Gallery:**
- Share your best work with the community
- Build your portfolio
- Get inspiration from others
- Perfect for marketing and case studies

**Private Gallery:**
- Keep client work confidential
- Internal team access only
- Secure project materials
- Default for all new renders

### Integration with Projects & Render Chains

The gallery doesn't exist in isolation. It's deeply integrated:

```text
Project: "Downtown Masterplan"
  └─ Render Chain: "Option A - Modern"
      ├─ v1: Initial concept
      ├─ v2: Refined materials
      └─ v3: Final presentation
```

Every render knows where it belongs. No manual filing required.

## Building Your Visual Archive

### Strategy 1: Project-Based Organization

Create separate projects for different clients or concepts:

```text
Projects/
├── Client-A-Residential/
├── Client-B-Commercial/
├── Portfolio-Pieces/
└── Internal-Experiments/
```

Each project becomes its own archive section automatically.

### Strategy 2: Use Collections

Collections let you group renders across projects:

```text
Collections/
├── "Material Studies" (wood, concrete, glass)
├── "Successful Client Presentations"
├── "Style References" (modern, traditional, etc.)
└── "Rejected But Useful" (for learning)
```

### Strategy 3: Tagging System

Add tags for easy filtering:

```text
Tags: #exterior #residential #modern #client-approved
```

Search by any tag to find related renders instantly.

## Real-World Workflow

### Scenario: Client Presentation Prep

```text
1. Search gallery: "Client-A-Residential"
2. Filter by tag: #client-approved
3. Sort by date: Most recent first
4. Export selected renders
5. Done in 2 minutes (not 20)
```

### Scenario: Finding Reference Material

```text
1. Search: "concrete facade"
2. Browse public gallery for inspiration
3. Save to collection: "Material References"
4. Reference in new project
```

## Advanced Features

### Search & Filter

The gallery search is powerful:

```text
Search: "downtown masterplan"
Filter: Last 30 days
Sort: By project, then date
Result: All relevant renders in seconds
```

### Version History

See how a render evolved:

```text
Render Chain: "Option A"
├─ v1: Initial sketch render
├─ v2: Added materials
├─ v3: Refined lighting
└─ v4: Final presentation version
```

Click any version to see the full history.

## Best Practices

1. **Name projects clearly**: "Client-Project-Type" format works well
2. **Tag consistently**: Use standard tags across all projects
3. **Use collections**: Build reference libraries for common needs
4. **Share strategically**: Public for portfolio, private for clients
5. **Leverage render chains**: Track iterations automatically

## Common Questions

**Q: Can I organize renders manually?**
A: The gallery auto-organizes by project, but you can create custom collections and add tags for additional organization.

**Q: How do I share renders with my team?**
A: Team members with project access can see all renders in that project's gallery. Use private galleries for client work.

**Q: Can I export entire collections?**
A: Yes, you can export multiple renders at once from any collection or project view.

**Q: Is gallery organization free?**
A: Yes! The free tier includes full gallery access with project organization, render chain integration, and search/filter capabilities.
