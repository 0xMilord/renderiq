```

## How Students Actually Use It

### Portfolio Development

**The Workflow:**
```text
1. Upload sketch from studio project
2. Generate render (30-60 seconds)
3. Export HD for portfolio
4. Share in gallery
5. Done.

Time: 2 minutes
Cost: $0
Result: Portfolio-quality render
```

**Monthly Strategy:**
```text
Month 1: Portfolio pieces
├─ 3x High quality renders (6 credits)
└─ 2x Standard iterations (2 credits)
Total: 8 credits needed → Upgrade or wait 2 months

OR

Month 1: Learning + 1 portfolio piece
├─ 1x Standard test (1 credit)
├─ 1x High quality final (2 credits)
└─ 2x Standard iterations (2 credits)
Total: 5 credits → Perfect for free tier
```

### Concept Exploration

```text

v2: "Make it more modern" → @v1 (Standard - 1 credit)
v3: "Add better materials" → @v2 (High - 2 credits)
v4: "Refine lighting" → @v3 (Standard - 1 credit)

Total: 5 credits, 4 iterations, 1 final piece
```

## Comparison: Free vs. Paid Tools

### Generic Free Tools

## Tips for Maximizing Free Tier

### Strategy 1: Plan Your Renders

```text
Monthly Budget: 5 renders

Option A: Portfolio Focus
├─ 3x High quality (6 credits) → Need upgrade
└─ 2x Standard (2 credits)

Option B: Learning Focus
├─ 1x High quality (2 credits)
└─ 4x Standard (4 credits)
Total: 6 credits → Need upgrade

Option C: Balanced
├─ 2x High quality (4 credits)
└─ 1x Standard (1 credit)
Total: 5 credits → Perfect!
```

### Strategy 2: Use Render Chains Efficiently

```text
Start with one render, iterate smartly:

v1: Base concept (Standard - 1 credit)
v2: "Refine materials" → @v1 (Standard - 1 credit)
v3: "Better lighting" → @v2 (High - 2 credits)
Final: v3 exported in HD

Total: 4 credits, 3 iterations, 1 final piece
```

### Strategy 3: Organize with Projects

```text
Projects/
├── "Portfolio-2025" (2 renders)
├── "Studio-Project-A" (2 renders)
└── "Experiments" (1 render)

Keep everything organized from day one
```
