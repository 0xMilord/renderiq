# Exploded Diagram Generator: Create Architectural Axonometric Exploded Views

Ever tried explaining a wall assembly in a meeting? "So the sheathing goes here, then the studs, then the insulation..." while pointing at a flat elevation drawing. Your audience is lost.

An exploded diagram fixes that. It pulls the building apart, showing each layer separated with space between them. Like a technical drawing that's been gently pulled apart so you can see inside.

## The Process

Upload your render or diagram. The AI identifies the components—walls, floors, structural elements—and "explodes" them apart. You control the spacing: tight for detailed views, medium for clarity, or wide for maximum separation.

The result is an axonometric exploded view (that technical drawing style architects use) where everything is separated just enough to see how it all fits together. Perfect for explaining construction sequences, showing assembly logic, or documenting how things go together.

Pick spacing: tight (detailed), medium (balanced), or wide (maximum separation). Choose orientation: vertical, horizontal, or diagonal. Upload, configure, generate—30-60 seconds later you've got an exploded view that shows how everything fits together.

[Try it](/apps/architectural-exploded-diagram-generator) and create exploded diagrams that actually explain how things assemble.
