# Floor Plan Technical Diagrams: Create Annotated Architectural Diagrams

You've got a floor plan. But does it have room labels? Dimensions? Door swing indicators? All those little details that turn a plan into actual documentation?

This tool adds them. Upload your plan, pick an annotation level (minimal, standard, or detailed), and get back a properly annotated technical diagram. The kind contractors and permit offices expect to see.

## What Gets Added

Room labels (Bedroom 1, Kitchen, Living Room). Dimensions showing actual sizes. Door symbols with swing directions. Window indicators. Standard architectural symbols contractors understand.

You control how much: minimal annotations for quick reference, standard for most construction docs, or detailed for comprehensive documentation. The AI adds the right symbols in the right places, following architectural drafting standards.

Upload your plan, pick annotation level (minimal, standard, or detailed), and get back a properly annotated diagram. 30-60 seconds later, you've got construction-ready documentation.

[Try it](/apps/floor-plan-technical-diagram-generator) and turn plans into technical diagrams.
