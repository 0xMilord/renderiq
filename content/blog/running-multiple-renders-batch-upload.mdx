# Running Multiple Renders at Once: How Batch Processing Saves Hours

Renderiq's batch processing feature lets you process multiple architectural drawings (floor plans, elevations, sections) from a single project simultaneously, saving hours in your workflow.

## The Time Savings

### Traditional Workflow

- Upload floor plan: 10 seconds
- Generate render: 60 seconds
- Wait for completion
- Upload elevation: 10 seconds
- Generate render: 60 seconds
- Wait for completion
- Upload section: 10 seconds
- Generate render: 60 seconds
- Repeat for each drawing...

**Time: 2+ minutes per render, sequential**

### Batch Workflow

- Upload all architectural drawings (floor plans, elevations, sections): 30 seconds
- Process all renders in batch: 60-90 seconds
- Review all results: 2 minutes

**Time: Under 3 minutes for multiple architectural drawings**

## Use Cases

### Complete Project Documentation

- Process all floor plans, elevations, and sections at once
- Generate consistent renders across all project drawings
- Create complete visualization sets for presentations
- Maintain style consistency across multiple views

### Client Presentations

- Generate all required views simultaneously
- Prepare complete project visualization packages
- Create consistent presentation materials
- Build comprehensive option sets

### Design Development

- Process multiple design iterations quickly
- Compare different drawing sets efficiently
- Generate visualization sets for design reviews
- Maintain consistency across project phases

## Best Practices

1. **Prepare images**: Have all inputs ready
2. **Organize files**: Name files clearly
3. **Batch upload**: Process together
4. **Review systematically**: Compare results

## How Renderiq Enables Batch Processing

### Batch Processing for Architectural Drawings

- Process multiple floor plans, elevations, and sections simultaneously
- Each drawing type gets its own optimized prompt automatically
- All renders processed in parallel for maximum efficiency
- Track all renders in render chains automatically

### Unified Chat Interface

- Upload all architectural drawings in one session
- Batch processing handles multiple drawing types intelligently
- Each render tracked automatically in your project
- Organize batch work efficiently with projects

### Render Chains for Organization

- Each render from batch processing tracked automatically
- Build on previous renders using @v1, @v2, @latest
- Compare variations side-by-side
- Organize complete project sets efficiently

### Project Management

- Create separate projects for different building projects
- Organize by client, concept, or phase
- Easy access to all batch results
- Gallery integration for sharing

## Best Practices for Batch Processing

1. **Prepare all drawings**: Have all floor plans, elevations, and sections ready before starting
2. **Organize files**: Name files clearly to identify drawing types (e.g., "floor-plan-01.jpg", "elevation-north.jpg")
3. **Use projects**: Create separate projects for different building projects
4. **Leverage render chains**: Track all renders automatically in your project
5. **Review systematically**: Compare results side-by-side for consistency
6. **Export strategically**: Use HD for quick reviews, 4K for final presentations

## Conclusion

Batch processing saves hours by letting you process all architectural drawings (floor plans, elevations, sections) from a project simultaneously. With Renderiq's batch processing feature, unified chat interface, render chains, and project management, you can generate complete visualization sets efficiently.

Whether you're preparing client presentations, creating project documentation, or building portfolio materials, batch processing helps you work faster and maintain consistency across all project views.

**Key Advantages:**
- Process multiple architectural drawings simultaneously
- Automatic prompt optimization for each drawing type
- Unified chat interface for easy batch management
- Render chains track all renders automatically
- Projects organize complete project sets efficiently
- Free tier includes batch processing capabilities

## People Also Ask

### How do I render multiple architectural drawings at once?
Upload all your architectural drawings (floor plans, elevations, sections) to Renderiq's unified chat interface, and use batch processing to render them simultaneously. All renders are tracked automatically in render chains, and you can organize complete project sets with projects—saving hours compared to sequential rendering.

### Can I batch process renders in Renderiq?
Yes! Renderiq supports batch processing for architectural drawings through the unified chat interface. Upload multiple floor plans, elevations, and sections, and Renderiq will process them simultaneously with optimized prompts for each drawing type. Organize results with render chains and projects—perfect for generating complete project visualization sets quickly.

### How much time does batch processing save?
Batch processing saves significant time: process multiple architectural drawings in parallel instead of sequentially. What takes 2+ minutes per render sequentially becomes under 3 minutes for multiple drawings—saving hours when processing complete project sets (floor plans, elevations, sections).

### Is batch processing free?
Yes! Renderiq's free tier includes batch processing capabilities. Upload multiple architectural drawings, process them in parallel, and organize results with render chains—all included in the free tier with 5 renders per month.
