# Running Multiple Renders at Once: How Batch Upload Saves Hours

Batch uploading transforms your workflow by letting you process multiple renders simultaneously.

## The Time Savings

### Traditional Workflow

- Upload image 1: 10 seconds
- Generate render 1: 60 seconds
- Wait for completion
- Upload image 2: 10 seconds
- Generate render 2: 60 seconds
- Wait for completion
- Repeat...

**Time: 2+ minutes per render, sequential**

### Batch Workflow

- Upload all images: 30 seconds
- Generate all renders: 60 seconds
- Review all results: 2 minutes

**Time: Under 3 minutes for multiple renders**

## Use Cases

### Design Exploration

- Test multiple concepts
- Explore material options
- Compare layouts
- Generate variations

### Client Presentations

- Create option sets
- Prepare comparison materials
- Generate presentation visuals
- Build option libraries

### Portfolio Development

- Process multiple projects
- Generate project sets
- Create visual collections
- Build portfolio materials

## Best Practices

1. **Prepare images**: Have all inputs ready
2. **Organize files**: Name files clearly
3. **Batch upload**: Process together
4. **Review systematically**: Compare results

## How Renderiq Enables Batch Workflows

### Unified Chat Interface

- Upload multiple images in one session
- Process renders in parallel
- Track all renders in render chains
- Organize batch work in projects

### Render Chains for Organization

- Each render tracked automatically
- Build on previous renders using @v1, @v2, @latest
- Compare variations side-by-side
- Organize options efficiently

### Project Management

- Create separate projects for different batches
- Organize by client, concept, or phase
- Easy access to all batch results
- Gallery integration for sharing

## Best Practices for Batch Workflows

1. **Prepare images**: Have all inputs ready before starting
2. **Organize files**: Name files clearly for easy identification
3. **Use projects**: Create separate projects for different batches
4. **Leverage render chains**: Track iterations automatically
5. **Review systematically**: Compare results side-by-side
6. **Export strategically**: Use HD for quick reviews, 4K for finals
