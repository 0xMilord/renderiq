# Free AI Rendering Tool for Architects — What You Can Do With Renderiq Free Tier

Let's cut through the marketing speak: Renderiq's free tier gives you real professional tools, not a watered-down demo. Here's exactly what you get and how to make the most of it.

## What's Actually Included (No Strings Attached)

### The Core Package

```text
✓ 5 renders per month (resets monthly)
✓ HD exports (1920x1080) - perfect for presentations
✓ Full unified chat interface - all features unlocked
✓ Render chains - version control included
✓ Project management - organize everything
✓ Public/private gallery - share or keep private
✓ All quality levels - Standard, High, Ultra
✓ All aspect ratios - 16:9, 9:16, 1:1, 4:3, 21:9
✓ No credit card required - seriously, none
✓ Commercial use - portfolios and personal projects OK
```

**What you can render:**
- Interiors (rooms, spaces, concepts)
- Exteriors (buildings, facades, sites)
- Floor plans (visualizations, layouts)
- Site photos (context, renovations)
- Sketches (concept development)
- 3D model snapshots (from SketchUp, Rhino, etc.)

## The Smart Way to Use 5 Renders

### Strategy 1: Quality Over Quantity

```text
Month 1: Test the waters
├─ 2x Standard quality (quick tests)
├─ 2x High quality (portfolio pieces)
└─ 1x Ultra quality (showstopper)

Result: You understand the tool + have portfolio pieces
```

### Strategy 2: Render Chain Efficiency

Start with one render, then iterate:

```text
v1: Initial concept (Standard - 1 credit)
  └─ "Make it more modern" → v2 (Standard - 1 credit)
      └─ "Add better lighting" → v3 (High - 2 credits)
          └─ Final: v3 exported in HD

Total: 4 credits, 3 iterations, 1 final piece
```

### Strategy 3: Project Organization

Create separate projects for different goals:

```text
Projects/
├── "Portfolio-2025" (2 renders)
├── "Client-Demo" (1 render)
└── "Learning-Experiments" (2 renders)
```

## Real-World Use Cases

### For Students

**Portfolio Development:**
```text
Goal: 3 portfolio pieces for application
Strategy:
├─ 3x High quality renders (6 credits)
└─ 2x Standard iterations (2 credits)
Total: 8 credits needed → Upgrade or wait 2 months
```

**Or:**
```text
Goal: Learn the tool + 1 portfolio piece
Strategy:
├─ 1x Standard test (1 credit)
├─ 1x High quality final (2 credits)
└─ 2x Standard iterations (2 credits)
Total: 5 credits → Perfect for free tier
```

### For Professionals

**Client Demo:**
```text
Goal: Show client what's possible
Strategy:
├─ 1x Ultra quality render (3 credits) - maximum impact
└─ 2x Standard variations (2 credits) - show options
Total: 5 credits → Impressive demo, no cost
```

## What You Can't Do (And When to Upgrade)

### Free Tier Limitations

```text
✗ Only 5 renders/month (not cumulative)
✗ HD only (no 4K exports)
✗ Standard processing queue (no priority)
✗ Best for learning/small projects
```

### When to Upgrade

Upgrade when you:
- Need more than 5 renders/month
- Require 4K exports for print
- Want priority processing (faster generation)
- Have commercial client work
- Need advanced project features
