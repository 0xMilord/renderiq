## How to Maximize Your Free Tier

### Strategy 1: Plan Your Renders

With 5 renders per month, plan strategically:
- Use Standard quality (1 credit) for quick iterations
- Save High quality (2 credits) for important renders
- Reserve Ultra quality (3 credits) for final presentations

### Strategy 2: Use Render Chains Effectively

Build on previous renders using version references:
- Start with @v1 for your first render
- Reference @latest to build on your best version
- Each iteration counts as a new render, so choose wisely

### Strategy 3: Organize with Projects

Create separate projects for:
- Different clients or concepts
- School projects vs. personal work
- Different design types (interiors, exteriors, plans)

### Strategy 4: Leverage the Gallery

- Share your best work publicly to build your portfolio
- Keep client work private
- Get inspiration from other users' public renders

## Free Tier Limitations

Understanding limitations helps you plan:

- **5 renders per month**: Resets monthly (not cumulative)
- **HD resolution only**: No 4K exports on free tier
- **Standard processing**: No priority queue access
- **Personal use focus**: Best for learning and small projects

## When to Upgrade to Pro

Consider upgrading when you:

- **Need more renders**: Unlimited renders for active projects
- **Require 4K exports**: High-resolution outputs for print or large displays
- **Want priority processing**: Faster generation times
- **Have commercial needs**: Professional client work requiring commercial license
- **Need advanced features**: Enhanced project organization and gallery features
