# Multi Angle View Generator: Create Multiple Architectural Perspectives

One render shows one view. But your design needs to be understood from multiple angles—how it looks from above, from eye level, from different sides. Creating multiple consistent renders means multiple camera setups, hoping the lighting matches, hoping the materials look the same.

This tool generates 2, 4, or 6 views automatically. Same lighting. Same materials. Different angles. All consistent.

## What You Get

Upload your render. Pick how many views you want (2 for basic coverage, 4 for comprehensive, 6 for complete documentation). Choose the angle types: aerial for layout understanding, eye-level for spatial feel, or mixed for variety.

The AI generates multiple perspectives showing the same design from different viewpoints. The lighting stays consistent. The materials match. The only thing that changes is the camera angle. Perfect for portfolios, presentations, or design reviews where you need to show the full picture.

## How It Works

Pick how many views: 2 for basic coverage, 4 for comprehensive, 6 for complete documentation. Choose angle types—aerial shows layout, eye-level shows spatial feel, mixed gives variety.

The AI generates all views with matching lighting and materials. Same design, different angles. All consistent.

1. Navigate to the [Multi Angle View Generator](/apps/multi-angle-architectural-view-generator)
2. Upload your architectural image
3. The AI will analyze the design structure

### Step 3: Select View Count

Choose number of views:

- **2 Views**: For focused perspectives
- **4 Views**: For comprehensive coverage
- **6 Views**: For complete documentation

### Step 4: Choose Angle Types

Select perspective types:

- **Aerial**: Top-down layout views
- **Eye-Level**: Human-scale perspectives
- **Mixed**: Combination of both types

### Step 5: Generate Multi-Angle Views

Click generate and wait 60-120 seconds. The tool will:

- Analyze architectural design
- Generate multiple camera angles
- Apply consistent lighting
- Create matching perspectives

### Step 6: Review and Use

Review the generated views:

- Check perspective consistency
- Verify lighting uniformity
- Ensure material matching
- Use for presentations or documentation

## Best Practices

### View Count Selection

- **2 Views**: For focused presentations
- **4 Views**: For most applications
- **6 Views**: For comprehensive documentation

### Angle Type Selection

- **Aerial**: For layout and relationship views
- **Eye-Level**: For spatial experience views
- **Mixed**: For complete visualization

### Input Quality

- Use high-quality architectural images
- Ensure key features are visible
- Good lighting in original
- Clear architectural elements

### Consistency Review

- Check lighting consistency
- Verify material matching
- Ensure color uniformity
- Review composition quality

## Technical Specifications

- **Input**: Single architectural image (JPG, PNG, WebP)
- **Output**: Multiple perspective views (2, 4, or 6)
- **Processing Time**: 60-120 seconds
- **View Counts**: 2, 4, or 6 views
- **Angle Types**: Aerial, eye-level, mixed
