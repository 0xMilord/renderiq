# Around the App

Welcome to Renderiq! Here's a quick tour of everything you can do.

## Three Ways to Create

### 1. Apps — 24 Specialized Tools

Visit [Apps](/apps) to browse our collection of AI-powered tools. Each app is designed for a specific task:

- **Sketch to Render** — Turn hand drawings into photorealistic renders
- **Render to CAD** — Generate floor plans, elevations, and sections
- **Change Texture** — Replace interior materials and textures
- **Render Upscale** — Enhance resolution up to 8x
- **3D to Render** — Convert 3D model screenshots to renders
- **Change Lighting** — Adjust interior lighting conditions
- **Presentation Board Maker** — Create client presentation boards
- And 17 more...

**How it works**: Upload your image, configure settings, and generate. No prompt writing needed.

### 2. Chat Interface — Conversational Rendering

The [Render page](/render) lets you chat with AI to create and refine designs:

- Natural conversation to describe what you want
- Upload sketches and reference images
- Iterate on designs with version control
- Reference previous renders with @mentions (@v1, @v2, @latest)

**Best for**: Exploring ideas, refining concepts, and iterative design.

### 3. Canvas — Node-Based Editor

The [Canvas](/canvas) is a visual workflow editor for complex pipelines:

- Drag-and-drop node editor
- Chain multiple AI operations
- Create reusable workflows
- Automate batch processing

**Best for**: Production workflows, multi-step processes, and advanced users.
