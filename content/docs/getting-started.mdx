# Getting Started

Welcome to Renderiq! In just a few minutes, you'll be transforming rough sketches into beautiful architectural visualizations.

## Create Your Account

1. Head to [Sign Up](/signup)
2. Sign up with Google, GitHub, or email
3. You'll get **25 free credits** to start creating immediately

## Three Ways to Create

Renderiq gives you three powerful interfaces for different workflows:

### 1. Apps — Quick, No-Prompt Tools

Browse our **32 specialized AI apps** at [/apps](/apps). Each app is purpose-built for a specific task:

- **Sketch to Render** — Transform hand drawings into photorealistic images
- **Render to CAD** — Generate floor plans, elevations, and sections
- **Material Swap** — Change materials across your design
- **Render Upscale** — Enhance resolution up to 8x
- And 28 more...

Just upload your image and hit generate — no prompt needed.

### 2. Chat Interface — Iterative Design

The [Render page](/render) gives you a conversational AI experience:

- Chat naturally with AI to refine your vision
- Upload sketches and reference images
- Iterate on designs with version control
- Reference previous renders with @mentions (@v1, @v2, @latest)

Perfect for exploring ideas and refining concepts through conversation.

### 3. Canvas — Node-Based Workflows

For complex, multi-step pipelines, use the [Canvas](/canvas):

- Visual node-based editor
- Chain multiple AI operations together
- Create reusable workflows
- Automate batch processing

Ideal for production workflows and advanced users.

## Your First Render

The fastest way to start:

1. Go to [Apps](/apps)
2. Pick a tool like **Sketch to Render**
3. Upload your image
4. Hit **Generate**

That's it — no prompt required for most apps.

## Understanding Credits

Credits are based on image quality:

| Quality | Credits | Best for |
|---------|---------|----------|
| Standard | 5 | Quick iterations, concept testing |
| High | 10 | Client presentations |
| Ultra | 15 | Final deliverables, portfolio pieces |

Video generation costs vary by duration and model.

## Organize Your Work

Keep your projects tidy:

- **Projects** — Group related renders together (e.g., "Beach House Concept")
- **Chains** — Track iterations of the same design
- **Library** — All your renders in one place
