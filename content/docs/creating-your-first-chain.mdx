# Creating Your First Chain

**Chains = Chats**. Each chain is a conversation that tracks multiple render versions as you iterate on your design.

## What is a Chain?

A chain is a chat conversation that:
- Groups related renders together (like a conversation thread)
- Maintains version history (each render is a version)
- Preserves context between renders (AI remembers previous turns)
- Tracks design evolution (see how your design changes)

**Important**: Chains only work on **render projects**. They don't work with tools or canvas projects.

## How Chains Work

Think of a chain as a conversation:
- **First render** = First message in chat (v1)
- **Second render** = Second message (v2)
- **Third render** = Third message (v3)
- And so on...

Each render is a **version** in the conversation. The AI remembers previous versions, so you can say "make it brighter" and it knows what "it" refers to.

## Creating a Chain

### Automatic Creation (Recommended)

Chains are created automatically when you generate your first render:

1. Go to [Render](/render)
2. Select a **render project** (not tools or canvas)
3. Generate your first render
4. A chain is created automatically named: `[Project Name] - Iterations`
5. Your render becomes **v1** in the chain

**That's it!** No setup needed.

### Using Existing Chains

1. Go to [Render](/render)
2. Select your render project
3. Choose an existing chain from the dropdown
4. Generate a render (it becomes the next version in that chain)

## Multiple Versions in a Chain

Each chain can have many versions:

- **v1** — First render
- **v2** — Second render (references v1)
- **v3** — Third render (references v1 and v2)
- **v4+** — More iterations

The AI uses previous versions as context, so later renders understand the full conversation history.

## Referencing Previous Versions

### In Chat

When generating a new render, reference previous versions:

- `@v1` — Reference the first render
- `@v2` — Reference the second render
- `@latest` — Reference the most recent render

### Visual References

Previous renders in the chain are shown above the chat:
- Click any render to use as reference
- The reference appears in your prompt automatically
- AI uses it to maintain consistency

## Managing Chains

### View All Chains

1. Go to your render project
2. Navigate to the "Chains" section
3. See all chains with version counts

### Chain Details

Each chain shows:
- Chain name and description
- Number of versions (renders)
- Creation date
- Last updated date
- Render previews (all versions)

### Edit Chain

1. Go to your chain
2. Click **"Edit Chain"**
3. Update name or description
4. Save changes

### Delete Chain

1. Go to your chain
2. Click **"Delete Chain"**
3. Confirm deletion

**Note**: Deleting a chain doesn't delete the renders, but removes them from the chain organization.

## Platform Limitations

**Chains only work on render projects**:
- ✅ **Render projects** — Chains work here
- ❌ **Tools projects** — No chains (each tool execution is independent)
- ❌ **Canvas projects** — No chains (uses files and node graphs instead)

If you're using tools or canvas, you don't need chains—those platforms work differently.

## Best Practices

**Naming**:
- Use descriptive names: "Exterior Design Iterations"
- Include context: "Kitchen Design - Client Feedback"
- Be consistent across projects

**Organization**:
- One chain per design direction
- Create new chains for major changes
- Archive completed chains

**Version Control**:
- Each render is a version—don't delete old versions
- Use version references (`@v1`, `@v2`) to maintain consistency
- Review version history to see evolution

## Troubleshooting

**Can't create chain**:
- Make sure you're using a **render project** (not tools or canvas)
- Check project permissions
- Verify project isn't archived

**Renders not appearing in chain**:
- Check if render was added to chain
- Verify you're viewing the correct chain
- Refresh the page

**Chain not updating**:
- Refresh the page
- Check if render generation completed
- Verify chain selection in dropdown
