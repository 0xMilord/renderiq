# Prompt Engineering

Writing effective prompts is key to getting great results from Renderiq. This guide will teach you how to craft prompts that produce the renders you envision.

## Understanding Prompts

A prompt is a text description that tells the AI what to generate. The better your prompt, the better your results.

### What Makes a Good Prompt?

1. **Specificity**: Clear and detailed descriptions
2. **Structure**: Organized information
3. **Context**: Relevant background information
4. **Style**: Consistent style references
5. **Constraints**: What to include/exclude

## Prompt Structure

### Basic Structure

```
[Subject] + [Style] + [Details] + [Environment] + [Quality Indicators]
```

### Example

```
Modern minimalist house with floor-to-ceiling windows, Scandinavian style, 
white walls and natural wood accents, surrounded by pine trees, 
sunny day with soft shadows, photorealistic, high detail, 
architectural photography style
```

## Key Components

### 1. Subject

Clearly describe what you're creating:
- **Building Type**: House, office, restaurant, etc.
- **Architectural Style**: Modern, traditional, contemporary, etc.
- **Key Features**: Windows, materials, layout, etc.

**Good Examples:**
- "Contemporary glass office building"
- "Traditional Japanese tea house"
- "Modernist concrete apartment complex"

**Poor Examples:**
- "Building"
- "Nice house"
- "Architecture"

### 2. Style

Specify the visual style:
- **Architectural Style**: Modern, Art Deco, Brutalist, etc.
- **Rendering Style**: Photorealistic, sketch, wireframe, etc.
- **Artistic Style**: Minimalist, ornate, industrial, etc.

**Examples:**
- "Brutalist concrete architecture"
- "Art Nouveau decorative style"
- "Minimalist Scandinavian design"

### 3. Materials and Textures

Describe materials explicitly:
- **Exterior**: Concrete, glass, wood, metal, stone
- **Interior**: Marble, hardwood, fabric, leather
- **Textures**: Smooth, rough, polished, weathered

**Examples:**
- "Weathered cedar wood siding"
- "Polished marble floors"
- "Raw concrete walls with formwork texture"

### 4. Environment and Context

Set the scene:
- **Location**: Urban, rural, coastal, mountain
- **Surroundings**: Trees, water, other buildings
- **Time of Day**: Morning, noon, sunset, night
- **Weather**: Sunny, cloudy, rainy, foggy

**Examples:**
- "Urban setting with city skyline in background"
- "Coastal location with ocean view"
- "Mountain setting surrounded by pine forests"

### 5. Lighting

Describe lighting conditions:
- **Natural Light**: Direct sun, diffused, golden hour
- **Artificial Light**: Warm, cool, accent lighting
- **Shadows**: Soft, hard, dramatic
- **Atmosphere**: Bright, moody, ethereal

**Examples:**
- "Golden hour sunlight casting long shadows"
- "Soft diffused daylight through large windows"
- "Dramatic evening lighting with warm interior glow"

### 6. Composition and Perspective

Guide the camera/view:
- **Angle**: Aerial, eye-level, low angle
- **Distance**: Close-up, medium, wide shot
- **Focus**: Foreground, background, specific elements

**Examples:**
- "Aerial view from above"
- "Eye-level perspective from street"
- "Close-up of entrance detail"

## Advanced Techniques

### Negative Prompts

Specify what to avoid:
- "No people, no vehicles, no text"
- "Avoid cluttered backgrounds"
- "No visible power lines or signs"

### Style References

Reference specific styles or architects:
- "In the style of Frank Lloyd Wright"
- "Bauhaus-inspired design"
- "Japanese minimalist aesthetic"

### Technical Details

Include architectural specifics:
- "Cantilevered structure"
- "Post-and-beam construction"
- "Curtain wall facade system"

### Mood and Atmosphere

Convey feeling:
- "Serene and peaceful"
- "Dynamic and energetic"
- "Luxurious and opulent"
- "Industrial and raw"

## Prompt Templates

### Exterior Architecture

```
[Building Type] in [Architectural Style], 
[Key Materials], [Notable Features], 
located in [Environment], 
[Time of Day] with [Lighting], 
[Perspective], [Style], [Quality]
```

### Interior Design

```
[Room Type] with [Style] design, 
[Key Materials and Colors], 
[Furniture and Layout], 
[Lighting Conditions], 
[View/Windows], [Mood], [Quality]
```

### Landscape Architecture

```
[Space Type] featuring [Elements], 
[Materials and Plants], 
[Layout and Flow], 
[Surrounding Context], 
[Time of Day], [Season], [Quality]
```

## Common Mistakes

### Too Vague
❌ "Nice building"
✅ "Modern glass office building with geometric facade"

### Too Complex
❌ "A building with everything"
✅ Focus on key elements

### Missing Context
❌ "House"
✅ "Contemporary single-family house in suburban setting"

### Inconsistent Style
❌ Mixing multiple conflicting styles
✅ Choose one style and be consistent

### Ignoring Environment
❌ "Building" (no context)
✅ "Building in urban setting with surrounding architecture"

## Iterative Refinement

### Start Broad
Begin with general concept:
"Modern house"

### Add Details
Refine with specifics:
"Modern minimalist house with large windows and flat roof"

### Include Context
Add environment:
"Modern minimalist house with large windows and flat roof, 
surrounded by mature trees, sunny day"

### Specify Style
Add rendering style:
"Modern minimalist house with large windows and flat roof, 
surrounded by mature trees, sunny day, 
photorealistic architectural photography"

## Using References

### Image References
- Upload clear reference images
- Describe what you want from the reference
- Combine multiple references
- Use as style guide, not exact copy

### Previous Renders
- Reference successful renders
- Build on what worked
- Use version mentions (@v1, @latest)
- Iterate on concepts

## Style-Specific Tips

### Photorealistic
- Include lighting details
- Specify camera settings
- Mention photography style
- Add realistic details

### Sketch/Illustration
- Mention drawing style
- Specify line weight
- Include artistic medium
- Add texture details

### Wireframe
- Focus on structure
- Mention line style
- Include technical details
- Specify view angle

## Quality Indicators

Add quality hints:
- "High detail"
- "Sharp focus"
- "Professional photography"
- "Architectural rendering quality"
- "4K resolution detail"

## Examples

### Good Prompt Example 1

```
Contemporary glass and steel office building, 
minimalist design with clean lines, 
curtain wall facade with bronze tinted glass, 
located in downtown urban setting, 
late afternoon golden hour lighting, 
aerial perspective, 
photorealistic architectural photography, 
high detail, professional rendering
```

### Good Prompt Example 2

```
Scandinavian-style single-family house, 
white painted wood siding with black window frames, 
pitched roof with dark shingles, 
surrounded by birch trees and wildflowers, 
soft morning light with gentle shadows, 
eye-level street view, 
photorealistic, 
warm and inviting atmosphere
```

### Good Prompt Example 3

```
Brutalist concrete apartment complex, 
raw concrete with visible formwork texture, 
geometric shapes and sharp angles, 
urban setting with other buildings visible, 
overcast day with diffused lighting, 
wide-angle perspective, 
photorealistic, 
dramatic and imposing presence
```

## Practice Tips

1. **Start Simple**: Begin with basic prompts
2. **Iterate**: Refine based on results
3. **Experiment**: Try different approaches
4. **Learn from Results**: See what works
5. **Build Library**: Save successful prompts
