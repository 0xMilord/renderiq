# Creating Your First Project

Projects organize your work. Each project can contain renders, chains, or canvas files depending on the platform.

## Quick Project Creation

Creating a project is fast—all fields are pre-filled for you:

1. Click **"New Project"** anywhere you see it
2. The modal opens with **auto-filled details**:
   - Project name (e.g., "Creative Studio")
   - Description (e.g., "A creative project for exploring new ideas")
   - Tags (e.g., "design, creative, art")
3. **Optionally customize** any field
4. **Optionally upload** a logo/image (or leave blank for auto-generated avatar)
5. Click **"Create Project"**

That's it! You can always edit details later.

## Three Types of Projects

### Render Projects (Default)

For chat-based rendering and iterative design:

- Created from [Render page](/render) or [Projects dashboard](/dashboard/projects)
- Used for conversational AI rendering
- Contains render chains for tracking iterations
- Platform: `render`

**When to use**: Chat-based design, iterative refinement, version control

### Tools Projects

For using specialized apps:

- Created automatically when you use an [app](/apps)
- No file upload needed
- Organizes tool executions
- Platform: `tools`

**When to use**: Using any of the 24 specialized tools

### Canvas Projects

For node-based workflows:

- Created from [Canvas page](/canvas)
- Contains **files** (like Figma: Project → File → Canvas)
- Each file has its own node-based workflow
- Platform: `canvas`

**When to use**: Complex multi-step pipelines, visual programming, automation

## Creating Canvas Files

Canvas projects work differently—they contain files:

1. Go to [Canvas](/canvas)
2. Select or create a canvas project
3. Click **"New File"** in the project
4. Enter file name and description
5. File opens at `/canvas/[projectSlug]/[fileId]` for editing

Each file is a separate node-based workflow within the project.

## Managing Projects

### View All Projects

- [Projects Dashboard](/dashboard/projects) — All your projects
- Filter by platform (render, tools, canvas)
- Search and sort

### Edit Project

1. Go to your project
2. Click **"Edit"**
3. Update name, description, or tags
4. Save changes

**Note**: Project URLs (slugs) can't be changed after creation.

### Organize with Tags

Add tags when creating or editing:
- Use consistent tags (e.g., "residential", "commercial")
- Multiple tags per project
- Helps with filtering (coming soon)

### Delete Project

1. Go to your project
2. Click **"Delete"**
3. Confirm deletion

**Warning**: This permanently deletes the project and all its content.

## Best Practices

**Naming**:
- Use descriptive names: "Modern House - 2024"
- Include context: "Client ABC - Office Building"
- Avoid generic: "Project 1", "Test"

**Organization**:
- One project per major design direction
- Use tags consistently
- Archive completed projects
- Delete unused projects

## Troubleshooting

**Can't create project**:
- Check you're signed in
- Verify project limits (check billing)
- Try refreshing the page

**Project not appearing**:
- Check filters/search
- Verify correct account
- Refresh the page
