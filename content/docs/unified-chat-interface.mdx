# Unified Chat Interface

The chat interface lets you create renders through conversation. Describe your design, get results, then refine with follow-up messages.

## Quick Start

1. Go to [Render](/render)
2. Select a project (or create one)
3. Type your design description
4. Click **Generate** or press Enter
5. Refine with follow-up prompts

## How It Works

### Basic Flow

**First render**:
- Type: "Modern house with large windows"
- Click Generate
- Render appears in chat

**Iterate**:
- Type: "Make it brighter" or "Add trees around it"
- AI remembers the previous render
- New version appears

**Reference previous versions**:
- Use `@v1` for first render
- Use `@v2` for second render
- Use `@latest` for most recent

## Controls

### Input

- **Text prompt**: Describe what you want
- **Image upload**: Drag & drop or click to upload
- **Send**: Generate button or Enter key

### Settings

**Quality**:
- Standard (5 credits) — Fast, good quality
- High (10 credits) — Better quality
- Ultra (15 credits) — Best quality

**Aspect Ratio**:
- 16:9 (widescreen)
- 9:16 (portrait)
- 1:1 (square)
- 4:3 (traditional)

**Style**:
- Realistic — Photorealistic
- Sketch — Hand-drawn style
- Wireframe — Technical
- Illustration — Artistic

### Advanced Options

- **Environment**: Sunny, overcast, sunset, night
- **Temperature**: Creativity level (0.0–1.0)
- **Negative prompt**: What to avoid
- **Seed**: For reproducible results

## Render Actions

Each render has options:

- **View**: Click to see full size
- **Download**: Save original quality
- **Share**: Generate shareable link
- **Iterate**: Use as reference for next render
- **Upscale**: Increase resolution (2x, 4x, 10x)

## Tips

**Writing prompts**:
- Be specific: "Modern house" → "Modern minimalist house with floor-to-ceiling windows"
- Include style: "Scandinavian style, white walls"
- Add environment: "Surrounded by pine trees, sunny day"

**Using references**:
- Upload clear images
- Reference previous renders with `@v1`, `@v2`, `@latest`
- Combine multiple references

**Iterating**:
- Start broad, then refine
- Build on successful renders
- Use version references to maintain consistency

## Keyboard Shortcuts

- **Enter**: Send message
- **Shift + Enter**: New line
- **Cmd/Ctrl + K**: Focus input
- **Esc**: Close modals

## Troubleshooting

**Render not generating**:
- Check credits balance
- Verify prompt isn't empty
- Check internet connection

**Poor quality results**:
- Increase quality setting
- Add more detail to prompt
- Use reference images

**Slow generation**:
- Lower quality setting
- Try again later
