    "raw": "\r\n# Render to Section Drawing Tool: Convert Renders to Technical CAD Sections\r\n\r\nYou've got the perfect render. Clients love it. But now you need section drawings for the permit application, and the city doesn't accept pretty renders—they want technical drawings with proper linework, dimensions, and annotations.\r\n\r\nCreating sections manually means:\r\n- Tracing over renders (tedious)\r\n- Converting to CAD linework (time-consuming)\r\n- Adding dimensions and annotations (error-prone)\r\n- Making sure it meets drafting standards (stressful)\r\n\r\nOr you could just convert your render.\r\n\r\n## What's a Section Drawing Anyway?\r\n\r\nA section drawing is like slicing a building in half and looking at the cross-section. It shows what's inside—walls, floors, structural elements, materials, dimensions. Contractors need them to build. Cities need them for permits. Clients need them to understand the design.\r\n\r\nBasically, it's the technical version of your render that construction and permitting actually require.\r\n\r\n## How It Actually Works\r\n\r\nUpload your render, pick a drawing style (technical CAD, 3D cross-section, or illustrated 2D), add text labels if you want, and generate. The AI figures out the structure, converts it to proper linework, maintains proportions, and creates a section drawing that actually meets drafting standards.\r\n\r\nThe AI gets architectural context—it knows what walls are, what structural elements matter, what dimensions are important. It's not just converting an image; it's creating actual technical drawings.\r\n\r\n## What You Get\r\n\r\n### Three Drawing Styles\r\n\r\n**Technical CAD**: Clean linework, proper annotations, ready for construction docs. This is what permits want.\r\n\r\n**3D Cross-Sections**: Axonometric views that show structure clearly. Good for explaining design to clients and contractors.\r\n\r\n**Illustrated 2D**: Stylized but still technical. Makes technical info more accessible to non-technical audiences.\r\n\r\n### Control What You Need\r\n\r\nAdd text labels, reference existing drawing styles, customize line weights. You control the details that matter to your project.\r\n\r\n## When You'd Actually Use This\r\n\r\n**Permits**: Cities need technical drawings. This gets you from render to permit-ready section fast.\r\n\r\n**Construction docs**: Contractors need to see structure. Convert renders to technical drawings they can actually use.\r\n\r\n**Client explanations**: Sometimes clients need to understand what's inside the walls. Illustrated sections help.\r\n\r\n**Design development**: When you need sections for design work but don't want to draft them manually.\r\n\r\n## The Quick Process\r\n\r\n1. **Upload your render** - The one showing the space you want to section\r\n2. **Pick a style** - Technical CAD for permits, 3D for explanations, illustrated for clients\r\n3. **Add labels if you want** - Or let the AI handle it\r\n4. **Generate** - 30-60 seconds later, you've got a section drawing\r\n\r\nNo tracing. No CAD work. Just conversion.\r\n\r\n## Tips That Actually Help\r\n\r\nUse good renders. Clear structure visibility = better sections. The AI needs to see what's going on.\r\n\r\nPick the right style. Permits want technical CAD. Clients prefer illustrated. Know your audience.\r\n\r\nGenerate a few versions. Compare them, pick the best, refine if needed.\r\n\r\n## Why This Actually Works\r\n\r\nThe AI gets architecture. It's not just converting images—it understands structure, knows what matters for construction, creates drawings that meet standards. Generic converters don't do that.\r\n\r\nIt's fast. Minutes instead of hours. No manual drafting, no CAD conversion, just results.\r\n\r\nIt works with your workflow. Organize by project, track versions, share with teams. It fits how you actually work.\r\n[Try it](/apps/ai-architectural-section-drawing-tool) and stop tracing renders.\r\n\r\n",
