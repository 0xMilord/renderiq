          "raw": "\r\n# 3D Model Snapshots, Meet Their AI Makeover\r\n\r\nLet’s be honest: exporting a view from SketchUp, Rhino, or Revit can feel a bit underwhelming. You slave over every line and plane, but the resulting image just… sits there. Flat. Cold. Not exactly the stuff of client wow-moments. Traditionally, making your model look amazing meant learning complex software, tweaking endless settings, and maybe, just maybe, praying to the rendering gods for a result that didn’t take all night.\r\n\r\nBut what if great renders were fun? What if AI handled the “scary” stuff—materials, lighting, atmosphere—so you could focus on design and storytelling? \r\n\r\nIn this guide, we’ll show you how Renderiq transforms basic 3D model snapshots into polished, client-ready visuals with almost no learning curve and minimal effort. You don’t need expensive plugins, special hardware, or a master’s degree in rendering. Just bring your model view, your imagination, and let’s go.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Why Rendering Feels Like a Chore\r\n\r\n### Minutes to Learn, Hours to Render\r\n\r\nIf you’ve ever spent an entire afternoon elbow-deep in material settings, camera angles, and sunlight sliders, you’re not alone. Traditional rendering workflows go something like this:\r\n- Gather and apply realistic materials from endless libraries.\r\n- Adjust lights so your model isn’t a soulless gray block.\r\n- Wrestle with cameras and render settings.\r\n- Hit “render.” Wait. Make coffee. Re-render. Repeat.\r\n\r\n**Result:** 2-8 hours or more, a few new gray hairs, and often, a still-unfinished look.\r\n\r\n### The Technical Rabbit Hole\r\n\r\nRender engines like V-Ray, Enscape, or Lumion pack amazing power… if you know what you’re doing:\r\n- Steep learning curves\r\n- Hardware that costs as much as a vacation\r\n- Plugins on plugins \r\n- Never-ending updates and compatibility issues\r\n\r\n### The Price Tag\r\n\r\nProfessional rendering software does not come cheap:\r\n- V-Ray: $700+/year\r\n- Enscape: $500+/year\r\n- Lumion: $1,500+/year\r\n- Add a powerful computer: $2,000+\r\n\r\nNot exactly friendly for fast, everyday visualization.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Enter AI Rendering: Fast. Fun. Effortless.\r\n\r\n### From Snapshot to Showpiece (in Under a Minute)\r\n\r\nNow, imagine this: \r\n- Export your 3D model view (from SketchUp, Rhino, or Revit)\r\n- Drag and drop the image into Renderiq\r\n- Tell AI what style, mood, or material you want—in plain English\r\n- Click “generate”\r\n- In less than a minute: get a professional, beautifully lit, ready-to-share render\r\n\r\nNo more sweating over settings or wading through forums.\r\n\r\n### No Learning Curve, No Stress\r\n\r\nRenderiq’s AI takes care of:\r\n- Applying realistic materials (glass, steel, wood—whatever your heart desires)\r\n- Balancing lighting and shadows, indoors or outdoors\r\n- Adding context (skies, landscapes, city scenes)\r\n- Final color and detail polishing\r\n\r\nAll you do is describe your intent. The AI does the lifting.\r\n\r\n### Affordable for Everyone\r\n\r\n- Start free with 5 renders each month\r\n- Go pro for $29/month if you need more or want 4K output\r\n- All cloud-based—no hardware upgrades required\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## How to Use Renderiq: A Breezy Step-by-Step\r\n\r\n### 1. Export That View\r\n\r\nFrom your favorite 3D tool:\r\n\r\n**SketchUp:**  \r\n- Compose your view  \r\n- Export as PNG or JPG (go high-res—1920x1080 or higher)  \r\n- Shadows? Include if it adds clarity\r\n\r\n**Rhino:**  \r\n- Set up the viewport  \r\n- Export as image—clean background preferred  \r\n\r\n**Revit:**  \r\n- Switch to a 3D view  \r\n- Export using high settings  \r\n- Add some context/background if you want\r\n\r\n### 2. Create a Project & Upload\r\n\r\n- Log in to Renderiq (the free tier gives you room to experiment)\r\n- Start a new project (e.g., “Downtown Office Concept”)\r\n- In the unified chat interface, drag and drop your image or click to upload\r\n- Compatible formats: JPG, PNG, WebP\r\n- Renderiq automatically organizes “render chains” (perfect for iterations and history)\r\n\r\n### 3. Describe What You Want\r\n\r\nJust type it out—no jargon needed:\r\n\r\n**Materials:**  \r\n- “Modern glass and steel exterior”  \r\n- “Warm timber and stone, like a mountain lodge”  \r\n- “Industrial concrete and dark metal accents”\r\n\r\n**Style & Lighting:**  \r\n- “Bright, sunny day, photoreal style”  \r\n- “Soft twilight, inviting indoor glow”  \r\n- “Minimal, sharp lines for a conceptual look”\r\n\r\n**Context:**  \r\n- “Urban skyline background”  \r\n- “Nestled in a scenic forest”  \r\n- “In a pedestrian-friendly plaza”\r\n\r\n**Quality:**  \r\n- Standard: Quick feedback  \r\n- High: Ready for client previews  \r\n- Ultra: Final, print-worthy (Pro only)\r\n\r\n### 4. Generate, Review, Iterate\r\n\r\n- Hit generate or press enter  \r\n- Watch as Google Gemini 3 Pro spins your view into a polished render in about a minute  \r\n- Love it? Export, share, brag  \r\n- Want tweaks? Reference earlier versions with @v1, @v2, etc.  \r\n- Keep building on ideas—each iteration is tracked automatically\r\n\r\n### 5. Export Like a Pro\r\n\r\n- HD downloads (free for everyone!)\r\n- 4K for ultra-sharp results (Pro feature)\r\n- Exports are ready for emails, presentations, websites, and more\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## What the AI Actually Does\r\n\r\n**Materials:** Automatically swaps dull surfaces for realistic textures—keeping architectural logic intact.\r\n\r\n**Lighting:** Simulates natural sunlight, soft shadows, and lifelike reflections. No more “gymnasium glow.”\r\n\r\n**Context:** Adds skies, environments, and sometimes even site-specific hints to ground the building.\r\n\r\n**Post-Processing:** The final sprinkle—color correction, balance, all the magic that makes renders “pop.”\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Who's Using This (And Why You'll Want To)\r\n\r\n### Concept & Schematic Design\r\n\r\n- Sketch ideas rapidly\r\n- Show clients multiple directions\r\n- Visualize options side by side\r\n\r\n### Client Presentations\r\n\r\n- Stunning images, zero hassle\r\n- Impress with speed (and style)\r\n- Get feedback instantly\r\n\r\n### Marketing, Competitions, Portfolios\r\n\r\n- Make your designs stand out\r\n- Build polished presentation boards\r\n- Update your website with wow-factor visuals\r\n\r\n### Internal Reviews & Team Communication\r\n\r\n- Share ideas visually\r\n- Compare, collaborate, iterate\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Pro Tips for Killer AI Renders\r\n\r\n### Always Start with a Good Base\r\n\r\n- Use crisp, high-res exports\r\n- Compose clean, clear views\r\n- Avoid clutter and odd angles\r\n\r\n### Tell the AI What Matters\r\n\r\n- Be specific (“contemporary glass brise-soleil, evening lights, urban setting” beats “make it nice”)\r\n- Upload reference images for style or mood if you have them\r\n\r\n### Don’t Settle—Iterate!\r\n\r\n- Explore different looks: change up materials, test lighting, try new contexts\r\n- Use render chains to keep your best versions organized\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Should You Still Use Traditional Rendering?\r\n\r\nMaybe! Here’s the honest rundown:\r\n\r\n**Traditional Rendering:**  \r\n- Total control, unrivaled realism—for those with experience, time, and big hardware\r\n\r\n**AI Rendering (like Renderiq):**  \r\n- Fast, fun, right-now visuals—perfect for early design, presentations, and anyone who wants to skip the pain\r\n\r\nMost designers use both.

          "raw": "\r\n# Best AI Tool to Convert Site Photos Into Architectural Renders\r\n\r\nSite photo rendering is one of the most powerful applications of AI in architecture. Instead of starting from scratch, you can take an existing site photo and show exactly how your design will look in that specific location. This is invaluable for renovations, extensions, new construction, and landscape design.\r\n\r\n## Why Site Photo Rendering Matters\r\n\r\nArchitects and designers constantly face the challenge of showing clients how a design will look in its actual context. Traditional methods require:\r\n\r\n- Complex 3D modeling of the existing site\r\n- Careful matching of lighting and perspective\r\n- Time-consuming compositing work\r\n- Expensive rendering software\r\n\r\nAI-powered site photo rendering eliminates most of this work while producing more accurate results.\r\n\r\n## What Makes a Great Site Photo Rendering Tool?\r\n\r\nWhen evaluating AI tools for site photo rendering, consider:\r\n\r\n### 1. **Perspective Accuracy**\r\nThe tool must maintain the exact camera angle and perspective of your original photo.\r\n\r\n### 2. **Lighting Consistency**\r\nRealistic lighting that matches the time of day and weather conditions in your photo.\r\n\r\n### 3. **Context Awareness**\r\nUnderstanding of architectural elements, scale, and spatial relationships.\r\n\r\n### 4. **Material Realism**\r\nAccurate representation of materials that fit the existing environment.\r\n\r\n### 5. **Seamless Integration**\r\nThe new design should look like it was always part of the original photo.\r\n\r\n## Comparing Top Tools\r\n\r\n### Generic AI Image Generators\r\n\r\n**Midjourney, DALL-E, Stable Diffusion:**\r\n- ❌ Don't maintain perspective accuracy\r\n- ❌ Add random elements\r\n- ❌ Struggle with architectural context\r\n- ✅ Good for artistic exploration\r\n\r\n### Architecture-Specific Tools\r\n\r\n**Renderiq:**\r\n- ✅ Maintains perspective and camera angle\r\n- ✅ Understands architectural context\r\n- ✅ Preserves lighting conditions\r\n- ✅ Accurate material representation\r\n- ✅ Fast workflow (30-60 seconds)\r\n\r\n## How Renderiq's Site Photo Rendering Works\r\n\r\nRenderiq's unified chat interface powered by Google Gemini 3 Pro makes site photo rendering intuitive and fast.\r\n\r\n### Step 1: Create a Project\r\n\r\n1. Log into Renderiq and navigate to `/render` or `/dashboard/projects`\r\n2. Create a new project for your site visualization (e.g., \"Smith Residence Renovation\")\r\n3. Projects automatically create render chains to track your iterations\r\n\r\n### Step 2: Upload Your Site Photo\r\n\r\nIn the unified chat interface, upload your site photo:\r\n- **Supported formats**: JPG, PNG, WebP\r\n- **Recommended resolution**: Minimum 1920x1080 (HD) for best results\r\n- **Photo quality**: Clear, well-lit photos with consistent lighting work best\r\n- **Avoid**: Extreme wide-angle shots with distortion\r\n\r\n### Step 3: Describe Your Design Intent\r\n\r\nUse natural language in the chat interface to describe modifications:\r\n- \"Add a modern two-story extension to the right side with floor-to-ceiling windows\"\r\n- \"Replace the front facade with dark gray cladding and contemporary materials\"\r\n- \"Add a second-floor balcony overlooking the garden with glass railings\"\r\n- \"Modernize the exterior with new windows, updated cladding, and a contemporary front door\"\r\n\r\n### Step 4: Configure and Generate\r\n\r\nSet your rendering parameters:\r\n- **Quality**: Standard (1 credit) for quick tests, High (2 credits) or Ultra (3 credits) for final presentations\r\n- **Aspect Ratio**: Match your photo's aspect ratio or choose 16:9, 9:16, 1:1, 4:3, or 21:9\r\n- **Generate**: Click generate or press Enter\r\n\r\n### Step 5: Iterate with Render Chains\r\n\r\nBuild on your renders using version references:\r\n- Reference previous renders with @v1, @v2, or @latest\r\n- Continue the conversation to refine specific areas\r\n- All iterations are tracked in your render chain automatically\r\n- Export in HD or 4K when ready for presentations\r\n\r\n## Real-World Applications\r\n\r\n### Residential Renovations\r\n\r\nShow homeowners exactly how their renovation will look:\r\n- Kitchen extensions\r\n- Second-story additions\r\n- Facade modernizations\r\n- Landscape improvements\r\n\r\n### Commercial Projects\r\n\r\nDemonstrate design concepts for:\r\n- Storefront renovations\r\n- Office building modifications\r\n- Restaurant exterior updates\r\n- Retail space transformations\r\n\r\n### Development Proposals\r\n\r\nCreate compelling visuals for:\r\n- Planning applications\r\n- Community presentations\r\n- Investor pitches\r\n- Marketing materials\r\n\r\n## Best Practices for Site Photo Rendering\r\n\r\n### 1. **Choose the Right Photo**\r\n\r\n- **Good lighting**: Avoid harsh shadows or overexposed areas\r\n- **Clear subject**: The area you want to modify should be clearly visible\r\n- **Appropriate angle**: Match the angle you'd use for the final presentation\r\n- **High resolution**: Better quality input = better quality output\r\n\r\n### 2. **Be Specific in Your Prompts**\r\n\r\nInstead of: \"Make it modern\"\r\nUse: \"Replace brick facade with dark gray cladding, add large black-framed windows, and install a contemporary front door\"\r\n\r\n### 3. **Use Reference Images**\r\n\r\nUpload additional reference images to guide:\r\n- Material choices\r\n- Style direction\r\n- Color palettes\r\n- Design details\r\n\r\n### 4. **Iterate and Compare**\r\n\r\nGenerate multiple options to:\r\n- Explore different design directions\r\n- Compare material choices\r\n- Test various scales\r\n- Find the best solution\r\n\r\n## Common Challenges and Solutions\r\n\r\n### Challenge: Perspective Doesn't Match\r\n\r\n**Solution**: Ensure your site photo has minimal distortion. Use a standard camera lens (not extreme wide-angle) and maintain a level camera angle.\r\n\r\n### Challenge: Lighting Looks Unrealistic\r\n\r\n**Solution**: Renderiq automatically matches lighting conditions, but you can refine specific areas if needed. Consider the time of day in your original photo.\r\n\r\n### Challenge: Materials Don't Look Right\r\n\r\n**Solution**: Use specific material descriptions in your prompts and provide reference images for complex materials.\r\n\r\n## Why Renderiq Excels at Site Photo Rendering\r\n\r\n### Architecture-Aware AI\r\n\r\nUnlike generic tools, Renderiq's AI understands:\r\n- Architectural proportions and scale\r\n- Building typologies and styles\r\n- Material properties and applications\r\n- Spatial relationships and context\r\n\r\n### Fast Workflow with Unified Chat Interface\r\n\r\n- **Create project**: 10 seconds\r\n- **Upload photo**: 10 seconds (drag & drop in chat)\r\n- **Write prompt**: 30 seconds\r\n- **Generate render**: 30-60 seconds (using Google Gemini 3 Pro)\r\n- **Iterate with render chains**: 1-2 minutes per refinement\r\n- **Export**: Instant download\r\n\r\n**Total time**: Under 5 minutes for professional results, including iterations\r\n\r\n### Professional Quality\r\n\r\n- HD and 4K export options\r\n- Commercial use license available\r\n- Consistent, reliable results\r\n- Suitable for client presentations\r\n\r\n## Getting Started\r\n\r\n### Free Tier\r\n\r\nPerfect for testing the workflow:\r\n- 5 renders per month\r\n- HD resolution\r\n- All core features\r\n\r\n### Pro Tier\r\n\r\nFor professional use:\r\n- Unlimited renders\r\n- 4K resolution\r\n- Priority processing\r\n- Commercial license\r\n\r\n## Conclusion\r\n\r\nSite photo rendering is transforming how architects communicate design ideas. By showing designs in their actual context, you help clients visualize the final result more accurately than ever before.\r\n\r\nRenderiq's architecture-aware AI makes this process fast, accurate, and accessible.

AI makes this fast and easy.\r\n\r\n## The Traditional Problem\r\n\r\n### Time-Consuming Process\r\n\r\n- Rebuild models for each option\r\n- Reapply materials\r\n- Reset lighting\r\n- Re-render each variation\r\n\r\n**Time: Hours per option**\r\n\r\n## How AI Solves This\r\n\r\n### Fast Variation Generation\r\n\r\n- Start with one base render\r\n- Generate multiple variations\r\n- Compare options instantly\r\n- Refine chosen direction\r\n\r\n**Time: Minutes for multiple options**\r\n\r\n## Use Cases\r\n\r\n### Material Options\r\n\r\n- Test different materials\r\n- Compare color schemes\r\n- Explore finishes\r\n- Present options to clients\r\n\r\n### Lighting Variations\r\n\r\n- Different times of day\r\n- Various lighting styles\r\n- Mood exploration\r\n- Presentation options\r\n\r\n### Layout Studies\r\n\r\n- Space arrangement options\r\n- Furniture placement\r\n- Flow variations\r\n- Functional testing\r\n\r\n## Best Practices\r\n\r\n1. **Start with quality base**: Good input = good variations\r\n2. **Be specific**: Describe what should change\r\n3. **Use references**: Guide material choices\r\n4. **Compare systematically**: Review options side-by-side\r\n\r\n## How Renderiq Creates Consistent Options\r\n\r\n### Render Chains for Option Tracking\r\n\r\n- Start with one base render\r\n- Generate variations using @v1, @v2, @latest references\r\n- Track all options in render chains\r\n- Compare options side-by-side\r\n- Build on chosen direction\r\n\r\n### Unified Chat Interface\r\n\r\n- Natural language prompts for variations\r\n- Conversational refinement workflow\r\n- Version references for consistency\r\n- Real-time preview of options\r\n\r\n### Project Organization\r\n\r\n- Create separate projects for different option sets\r\n- Organize by client, concept, or phase\r\n- Easy access to all variations\r\n- Gallery integration for sharing\r\n\r\n## Step-by-Step: Creating Design Options\r\n\r\n### Step 1: Create Base Render\r\n\r\n1. Upload your sketch, photo, or model snapshot\r\n2. Generate initial render using unified chat interface\r\n3. Review for accuracy and style\r\n4. This becomes your base (@v1)\r\n\r\n### Step 2: Generate Variations\r\n\r\nUse render chains to create options:\r\n- **Material options**: \"Same design but with dark wood instead of light wood, referencing @v1\"\r\n- **Lighting variations**: \"Same space but with warm evening lighting, referencing @latest\"\r\n- **Layout studies**: \"Same room but with furniture arranged differently, referencing @v1\"\r\n\r\n### Step 3: Compare and Refine\r\n\r\n- Review all options in render chain\r\n- Compare side-by-side\r\n- Refine chosen direction\r\n- Export selected options\r\n\r\n## Conclusion\r\n\r\nAI makes creating design variations fast and easy. With Renderiq's render chains and unified chat interface, you can generate consistent design options from the same input without manual rework.\r\n\r\nWhether you're exploring material options, testing lighting variations, or studying layouts, Renderiq helps you create professional design options in minutes—not hours.\r\n\r\n**Key Advantages:**\r\n- Generate variations from one base render\r\n- Render chains track all options\r\n- Unified chat interface for easy variation creation\r\n- Maintain consistency across options\r\n- Free tier includes option generation\r\n\r\nReady to create consistent design options? [Try Renderiq free](/pricing) and experience rapid design iteration.\r\n\r\n## People Also Ask\r\n\r\n### How do I create design variations with AI?\r\nUpload your base sketch or photo to Renderiq, generate an initial render, then use render chains to create variations. Reference @v1, @v2, or @latest to maintain consistency while exploring material, lighting, or layout options.\r\n\r\n### Can AI create consistent design options?\r\nYes! Renderiq's render chains let you create consistent design options from one base render. Use version references to maintain consistency while exploring variations—perfect for client presentations and design exploration.\r\n\r\n### How do I compare design options?\r\nUse Renderiq's render chains to generate multiple options, then compare them side-by-side in your project. All variations are tracked automatically, making it easy to review and select the best option.\r\n\r\n### Is design option generation free?\r\nYes! Renderiq's free tier includes render chains for creating design options.

          "raw": "\r\n# How to Render a Floor Plan Using AI (Step-by-Step)\r\n\r\nFloor plans are the foundation of architectural design, but they can be difficult for clients to visualize. Converting floor plans into rendered visuals helps clients understand spatial relationships, flow, and design intent. With AI, this process is now faster and more accessible than ever.\r\n\r\n## Why Render Floor Plans?\r\n\r\n### Client Communication\r\n\r\nClients often struggle to visualize spaces from 2D plans. Rendered floor plans help them:\r\n- Understand spatial relationships\r\n- Visualize furniture placement\r\n- See material and color choices\r\n- Grasp the overall design concept\r\n\r\n### Marketing and Presentations\r\n\r\nRendered floor plans are powerful for:\r\n- Sales presentations\r\n- Marketing materials\r\n- Website listings\r\n- Social media content\r\n\r\n## Step-by-Step Process\r\n\r\n### Step 1: Prepare Your Floor Plan\r\n\r\nStart with a clean, clear floor plan:\r\n\r\n**Best Practices:**\r\n- High resolution (minimum 300 DPI)\r\n- Clear linework (no fuzzy or pixelated lines)\r\n- Proper scale indication\r\n- Room labels (optional but helpful)\r\n- Furniture layout (if applicable)\r\n\r\n**File Formats:**\r\n- PDF (vector preferred)\r\n- PNG or JPG (high resolution)\r\n- CAD exports (DXF, DWG)\r\n\r\n### Step 2: Create a Project and Upload\r\n\r\n1. Log into your Renderiq account (free tier available)\r\n2. Navigate to `/render` or `/dashboard/projects`\r\n3. Create a new project (e.g., \"Smith Residence Floor Plans\")\r\n4. In the unified chat interface, upload your floor plan image\r\n   - Drag and drop or click to upload\r\n   - Supported formats: JPG, PNG, WebP, PDF\r\n5. Projects automatically create render chains to track iterations\r\n\r\n### Step 3: Describe Your Vision\r\n\r\nUse Renderiq's conversational interface to describe what you want:\r\n\r\n**Style Examples:**\r\n- \"Convert this floor plan into a modern minimalist interior visualization with light wood floors and white walls\"\r\n- \"Render as a luxury residential space with high-end finishes and contemporary furniture\"\r\n- \"Create a professional office layout visualization showing collaborative workspaces\"\r\n- \"Transform into a cozy residential interior with warm materials and natural lighting\"\r\n\r\n**Quality Options:**\r\n- Standard (1 credit): Quick iterations\r\n- High (2 credits): Client presentations\r\n- Ultra (3 credits): Final deliverables\r\n\r\n**Aspect Ratios:**\r\n- Match your plan's proportions or choose 16:9, 9:16, 1:1, 4:3, or 21:9\r\n\r\n### Step 4: Add Context with Prompts\r\n\r\nEnhance your render with descriptive prompts:\r\n\r\n**Examples:**\r\n- \"Modern minimalist interior with light wood floors and white walls\"\r\n- \"Luxury residential space with high-end finishes\"\r\n- \"Contemporary office layout with collaborative workspaces\"\r\n- \"Cozy residential interior with warm materials\"\r\n\r\n### Step 4: Generate and Iterate with Render Chains\r\n\r\n**Initial Generation:**\r\n- Click generate or press Enter\r\n- Render completes in 30-60 seconds using Google Gemini 3 Pro\r\n- Review for accuracy and style\r\n- Check spatial relationships\r\n\r\n**Building on Previous Renders:**\r\n- Use @v1, @v2, or @latest to reference earlier versions\r\n- Continue the conversation to refine specific areas\r\n- Example: \"Make the kitchen more modern, referencing @latest\"\r\n- All iterations are tracked in your render chain automatically\r\n\r\n**Refinement Options:**\r\n- Adjust specific rooms or areas through conversation\r\n- Modify materials and colors with descriptive prompts\r\n- Change lighting conditions naturally\r\n- Generate variations by referencing previous renders\r\n\r\n### Step 5: Export Your Render\r\n\r\nChoose your export resolution:\r\n- **HD (1920x1080)**: Included in free tier, perfect for web and presentations\r\n- **4K (3840x2160)**: Pro tier feature, ideal for print and high-quality displays\r\n\r\n## Tips for Best Results\r\n\r\n### 1. Start with Quality Plans\r\n\r\nThe better your input, the better your output:\r\n- Use vector formats when possible\r\n- Ensure clear, defined lines\r\n- Include scale references\r\n- Remove unnecessary annotations\r\n\r\n### 2. Be Specific in Prompts\r\n\r\nInstead of: \"Make it look nice\"\r\nUse: \"Modern Scandinavian interior with light oak floors, white walls, and minimalist furniture\"\r\n\r\n### 3. Use Reference Images\r\n\r\nUpload reference images to guide:\r\n- Material choices\r\n- Color palettes\r\n- Style direction\r\n- Furniture styles\r\n\r\n### 4. Iterate and Compare\r\n\r\nGenerate multiple options to:\r\n- Explore different styles\r\n- Compare material choices\r\n- Test color schemes\r\n- Find the best representation\r\n\r\n## Common Use Cases\r\n\r\n### Residential Design\r\n\r\n- **New construction**: Show clients how their home will look\r\n- **Renovations**: Visualize changes to existing layouts\r\n- **Interior design**: Demonstrate furniture and decor placement\r\n- **Space planning**: Optimize room layouts\r\n\r\n### Commercial Projects\r\n\r\n- **Office layouts**: Show workspace configurations\r\n- **Retail spaces**: Visualize store layouts\r\n- **Restaurants**: Demonstrate dining arrangements\r\n- **Healthcare**: Show patient flow and spaces\r\n\r\n### Real Estate\r\n\r\n- **Property listings**: Enhance marketing materials\r\n- **Development proposals**: Show future layouts\r\n- **Sales presentations**: Help buyers visualize spaces\r\n\r\n## Advanced Techniques\r\n\r\n### Multi-Level Rendering\r\n\r\nFor multi-story buildings:\r\n1. Render each floor separately\r\n2. Use consistent style across levels\r\n3. Combine in presentation software\r\n4. Create a cohesive visual story\r\n\r\n### Material Specification\r\n\r\nSpecify materials in your prompts:\r\n- Flooring: \"Hardwood\", \"Tile\", \"Carpet\", \"Concrete\"\r\n- Walls: \"Painted\", \"Wallpaper\", \"Exposed brick\", \"Wood paneling\"\r\n- Ceilings: \"Exposed beams\", \"Suspended\", \"Vaulted\"\r\n\r\n### Lighting Design\r\n\r\nControl lighting conditions:\r\n- \"Bright natural daylight\"\r\n- \"Warm evening lighting\"\r\n- \"Professional office lighting\"\r\n- \"Cozy residential ambiance\"\r\n\r\n## Why Renderiq Works Best\r\n\r\n### Architecture-Aware AI\r\n\r\nRenderiq understands:\r\n- Spatial relationships\r\n- Scale and proportions\r\n- Architectural conventions\r\n- Interior design principles\r\n\r\n### Fast Workflow with Unified Chat Interface\r\n\r\n- **Create project**: 10 seconds\r\n- **Upload floor plan**: 10 seconds (drag & drop in chat)\r\n- **Write prompt**: 30 seconds\r\n- **Generate render**: 30-60 seconds (using Google Gemini 3 Pro)\r\n- **Iterate with render chains**: 1-2 minutes per refinement\r\n- **Export**: Instant download\r\n\r\n**Total time: Under 5 minutes** for professional results, including iterations\r\n\r\n### Professional Quality\r\n\r\n- Suitable for client presentations\r\n- Commercial use license available\r\n- Consistent, reliable results\r\n- Multiple export resolutions\r\n\r\n## Common Questions\r\n\r\n**Q: Do I need to know 3D modeling?**\r\nA: No! That's the advantage of AI rendering. Upload your plan and generate renders without any 3D modeling knowledge.\r\n\r\n**Q: Can I render multiple floors?**\r\nA: Yes, render each floor separately and combine them in your presentation software.\r\n\r\n**Q: How accurate are the renders?**\r\nA: Renderiq maintains the spatial relationships and proportions from your original plan while adding realistic materials and lighting.\r\n\r\n**Q: Can I use these for commercial projects?**\r\nA: Yes, with a Pro subscription, you can use renders for commercial projects and client presentations.\r\n\r\n## Conclusion\r\n\r\nRendering floor plans with AI is transforming how architects and designers communicate with clients.

          "raw": "\r\n# How to Render a Site Plan With AI (Instant Workflow)\r\n\r\nSite plans are essential for planning presentations, but they can be difficult for stakeholders to understand. Converting site plans into rendered visuals helps communicate design intent, spatial relationships, and project scope more effectively.\r\n\r\n## Why Render Site Plans?\r\n\r\nSite plan renders help:\r\n- **Communicate design intent** to clients and stakeholders\r\n- **Visualize masterplans** and large-scale projects\r\n- **Present zoning proposals** clearly\r\n- **Show landscape layouts** effectively\r\n- **Demonstrate project scope** visually\r\n\r\n## Step-by-Step Workflow\r\n\r\n### Step 1: Prepare Your Site Plan\r\n\r\nStart with a clean, clear site plan:\r\n- High resolution (minimum 300 DPI)\r\n- Clear linework and labels\r\n- Proper scale indication\r\n- Good contrast\r\n\r\n### Step 2: Create a Project in Renderiq\r\n\r\n1. Log into Renderiq (free tier available)\r\n2. Navigate to `/render` or `/dashboard/projects`\r\n3. Create a new project (e.g., \"Downtown Masterplan\")\r\n4. Upload your site plan in the unified chat interface\r\n   - Drag and drop or click to upload\r\n   - Supported formats: JPG, PNG, WebP, PDF\r\n\r\n### Step 3: Describe Your Vision\r\n\r\nUse natural language in the chat interface:\r\n\r\n**Style Examples:**\r\n- \"Convert this site plan into a professional planning visualization with clear building footprints and green spaces\"\r\n- \"Render as a landscape-focused masterplan emphasizing parks and open spaces\"\r\n- \"Create an urban context visualization showing the built environment and street layout\"\r\n- \"Transform into a conceptual masterplan with artistic interpretation\"\r\n\r\n**Quality Settings:**\r\n- Standard (1 credit): Quick iterations\r\n- High (2 credits): Client presentations\r\n- Ultra (3 credits): Final deliverables\r\n\r\n### Step 4: Generate and Iterate\r\n\r\n- Click generate or press Enter\r\n- Render completes in 30-60 seconds using Google Gemini 3 Pro\r\n- Review for accuracy and style\r\n- Use @v1, @v2, or @latest to reference and refine\r\n- Build iterations in your render chain\r\n- Export in HD (free tier) or 4K (Pro tier)\r\n\r\n## Use Cases\r\n\r\n- Masterplan presentations\r\n- Zoning applications\r\n- Landscape design\r\n- Development proposals\r\n- Community presentations\r\n\r\n## Best Practices\r\n\r\n1. **Start with quality plans**: High resolution, clear linework, proper scale\r\n2. **Be specific in prompts**: Describe the style, context, and focus areas\r\n3. **Use render chains**: Build on previous renders with version references\r\n4. **Organize with projects**: Create separate projects for different masterplans\r\n5. **Iterate efficiently**: Use Standard quality for tests, High/Ultra for finals\r\n\r\n## Why Renderiq Works Best for Site Plans\r\n\r\n### Architecture-Aware AI\r\n\r\nRenderiq's Google Gemini 3 Pro understands:\r\n- Urban planning conventions\r\n- Scale and proportions\r\n- Spatial relationships\r\n- Landscape and built environment context\r\n\r\n### Unified Chat Interface\r\n\r\n- Natural language prompts\r\n- Conversational refinement\r\n- Version references (@v1, @v2, @latest)\r\n- Real-time preview\r\n\r\n### Fast Workflow\r\n\r\n- Upload: 10 seconds\r\n- Generate: 30-60 seconds\r\n- Iterate: 1-2 minutes per refinement\r\n- Export: Instant\r\n\r\n**Total time: Under 5 minutes** for professional site plan renders\r\n\r\n## Common Questions\r\n\r\n**Q: Can I render multiple site plan variations?**\r\nA: Yes! Use render chains to create multiple iterations. Each variation is tracked automatically.\r\n\r\n**Q: What resolution should I use?**\r\nA: HD (1920x1080) is included in free tier and perfect for presentations. 4K (3840x2160) is available on Pro tier for print materials.\r\n\r\n**Q: Can I combine multiple site plans?**\r\nA: Render each plan separately, then combine them in your presentation software. Use consistent styles across plans.\r\n\r\n**Q: How accurate are the renders?**\r\nA: Renderiq maintains spatial relationships and proportions from your original plan while adding realistic context and materials.\r\n\r\n## Conclusion\r\n\r\nSite plan rendering with AI is revolutionizing how planners and architects communicate complex masterplans. Renderiq's architecture-aware AI makes this process fast, accurate, and accessible—no manual rendering required.\r\n\r\nThe unified chat interface lets you work naturally: upload your plan, describe your vision, and build iterations using render chains.

          "raw": "\r\n# How to Turn a Sketch Into a Render Using AI (Free + Fast Guide)\r\n\r\nArchitects and designers constantly search for ways to transform their initial sketches into professional renders quickly. Traditional rendering workflows require hours of 3D modeling, material setup, and lighting configuration. But what if you could skip all that and go directly from sketch to render?\r\n\r\n## Why Sketch-to-Render AI Matters\r\n\r\nThe sketch-to-render workflow is revolutionary because it respects your design intent. Unlike generic AI image generators that might distort proportions or add random elements, architecture-aware AI understands spatial relationships, scale, and context.\r\n\r\n### The Problem with Generic AI Tools\r\n\r\nMost AI image generators struggle with architectural sketches because they:\r\n\r\n- Don't understand architectural proportions\r\n- Add random elements that don't make sense\r\n- Distort spatial relationships\r\n- Ignore design context\r\n\r\n### How Renderiq Solves This\r\n\r\nRenderiq uses Google Gemini 3 Pro Image Preview, a state-of-the-art AI model specifically optimized for architectural visualization. This architecture-aware AI understands:\r\n\r\n- **Proportional accuracy**: Maintains your original design proportions and scale\r\n- **Spatial context**: Distinguishes between interior and exterior spaces intelligently\r\n- **Material consistency**: Applies realistic materials that make architectural sense\r\n- **Lighting logic**: Creates lighting that follows real-world architectural principles\r\n- **Design intent preservation**: Respects your original sketch's composition and elements\r\n\r\n## Step-by-Step: Sketch to Render in Minutes\r\n\r\n### Step 1: Prepare Your Sketch\r\n\r\nStart with a clear sketch. The better your input, the better your output:\r\n\r\n- **Clear linework**: Use dark, defined lines\r\n- **Simple composition**: Focus on the main design elements\r\n- **Good contrast**: Ensure your sketch has clear light/dark areas\r\n- **Context clues**: Include elements that indicate scale (doors, windows, furniture)\r\n\r\n### Step 2: Create a Project in Renderiq\r\n\r\n1. Log into your Renderiq account (free tier available with 5 renders/month)\r\n2. Navigate to `/render` or `/dashboard/projects`\r\n3. Create a new project or select an existing one\r\n4. Projects automatically create render chains to track your iterations\r\n\r\n### Step 3: Use the Unified Chat Interface\r\n\r\nRenderiq's conversational interface makes rendering intuitive:\r\n\r\n1. **Upload your sketch**: Drag and drop or click to upload your sketch image (JPG, PNG, WebP supported)\r\n2. **Describe your vision**: Type a natural language prompt describing what you want\r\n   - Example: \"Convert this sketch into a photorealistic modern office interior with natural lighting\"\r\n3. **Configure settings**:\r\n   - **Quality**: Standard (1 credit), High (2 credits), or Ultra (3 credits)\r\n   - **Aspect Ratio**: Choose from 16:9, 9:16, 1:1, 4:3, or 21:9\r\n   - **Style**: Select from predefined architectural styles\r\n4. **Generate**: Click generate or press Enter\r\n\r\n### Step 4: Iterate with Render Chains\r\n\r\nRenderiq's render chains let you build on previous renders:\r\n\r\n- **Reference previous renders**: Use @v1, @v2, or @latest to reference earlier versions\r\n- **Iterate naturally**: Continue the conversation to refine your design\r\n- **Track versions**: All renders in a chain are automatically organized\r\n- **Export options**: Download in HD or 4K resolution for presentations\r\n\r\n## Real-World Use Cases\r\n\r\n### For Architecture Students\r\n\r\n- **Portfolio development**: Quickly visualize design concepts\r\n- **Presentation prep**: Create professional visuals without complex software\r\n- **Design iteration**: Explore multiple design options rapidly\r\n\r\n### For Professional Architects\r\n\r\n- **Client presentations**: Show design intent clearly and quickly\r\n- **Early-stage visualization**: Communicate concepts before detailed modeling\r\n- **Option exploration**: Generate multiple design variations efficiently\r\n\r\n### For Interior Designers\r\n\r\n- **Space planning**: Visualize layout concepts from sketches\r\n- **Material selection**: See how different materials work together\r\n- **Client communication**: Show design ideas before committing to detailed plans\r\n\r\n## Tips for Best Results\r\n\r\n1. **Start with quality sketches**: Clear, well-defined sketches with good contrast produce better renders\r\n2. **Use descriptive prompts**: Combine your sketch with detailed text descriptions\r\n   - Example: \"Modern minimalist living room with floor-to-ceiling windows, light wood floors, and neutral color palette\"\r\n3. **Leverage render chains**: Build iterations using version references (@v1, @v2, @latest)\r\n4. **Organize with projects**: Create separate projects for different clients or design concepts\r\n5. **Experiment with quality levels**: \r\n   - Standard (1 credit) for quick iterations\r\n   - High (2 credits) for client presentations\r\n   - Ultra (3 credits) for final deliverables\r\n6. **Use the gallery**: Share your best work publicly or keep it private for client review\r\n7. **Export strategically**: Use HD for web presentations, 4K for print materials\r\n\r\n## Free vs. Paid: What You Get\r\n\r\n### Free Tier\r\n\r\n- **5 renders per month** (perfect for testing and learning)\r\n- **HD resolution exports** (1920x1080)\r\n- **Full access to unified chat interface**\r\n- **Render chains and project management**\r\n- **Public gallery sharing**\r\n- **All quality levels** (Standard, High, Ultra)\r\n- **All aspect ratios** (16:9, 9:16, 1:1, 4:3, 21:9)\r\n\r\n### Pro Tier\r\n\r\n- **Unlimited renders** (no monthly limits)\r\n- **4K resolution exports** (3840x2160)\r\n- **Priority processing** (faster generation times)\r\n- **Commercial use license** (use renders in client work)\r\n- **Advanced project organization**\r\n- **Enhanced gallery features**\r\n- **Email support**\r\n\r\n## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)\r\n\r\n**Q: How accurate are AI-generated renders from sketches?**\r\nA: Renderiq maintains proportional accuracy and respects your design intent.

You need specialized tools like Renderiq that understand buildings, maintain proportions, and preserve design intent.\r\n\r\nPowered by Google Gemini 3 Pro and featuring a unified chat interface, Renderiq solves the problems that plague generic AI tools. Render chains help maintain consistency across iterations, and projects organize your work efficiently.\r\n\r\n**Key Advantages:**\r\n- Architecture-aware AI understands your designs\r\n- Maintains accurate proportions and scale\r\n- Applies materials and lighting logically\r\n- Unified chat interface for professional workflow\r\n- Render chains ensure consistency\r\n- Free tier lets you test before committing\r\n\r\nReady to experience architecture-focused AI rendering? [Try Renderiq free](/pricing) and see why specialized AI beats generic tools for architecture.\r\n\r\n## People Also Ask\r\n\r\n### Why do generic AI tools fail for architecture?\r\nGeneric AI tools fail for architecture because they don't understand spatial relationships, distort proportions, add random elements, and create inconsistent results—making them unreliable for professional architectural visualization work.\r\n\r\n### What happens when you use Midjourney for architecture?\r\nMidjourney distorts building proportions, adds random architectural elements, changes design intent, and produces inconsistent results—making it unsuitable for professional architectural work that requires accuracy and reliability.\r\n\r\n### Can DALL-E render architecture accurately?\r\nNo, DALL-E distorts architectural proportions, adds impossible elements, and creates inconsistent results. Renderiq's architecture-aware AI maintains accuracy, applies materials logically, and provides consistent professional outputs.\r\n\r\n### Why do I need specialized AI for architecture?\r\nArchitecture requires understanding spatial relationships, maintaining proportions, applying materials logically, and creating realistic lighting—all things generic AI tools fail at. Renderiq's specialized AI understands architectural context and maintains design intent.\r\n\r\n## Related Content\r\n\r\n- [Why Renderiq Works Better for AEC & Retail Projects](/blog/why-renderiq-works-better-aec-retail-projects)\r\n- [Top Free Alternatives to Midjourney for Architectural Renders](/blog/top-free-alternatives-midjourney-architectural-renders)\r\n- [Best AI Rendering Tools for Architects in 2025](/blog/best-ai-rendering-tools-architects-2025)\r\n- [How to Fix Inconsistent AI Renders](/blog/how-to-fix-inconsistent-ai-renders)\r\n\r\n",

Applies materials logically (glass, concrete, wood, metal)\r\n- **Lighting principles**: Creates realistic lighting conditions\r\n- **Professional context**: Built specifically for AEC workflows\r\n- **Retail environments**: Understands store layouts and merchandising\r\n\r\n### Real Workflow Integration\r\n\r\n**Unified Chat Interface:**\r\n- Natural language prompts\r\n- Conversational refinement\r\n- Version references (@v1, @v2, @latest)\r\n- Real-time preview\r\n\r\n**Render Chains:**\r\n- Track iterations automatically\r\n- Build on previous renders\r\n- Organize design options\r\n- Version control built-in\r\n\r\n**Project Management:**\r\n- Organize work by project\r\n- Multiple projects support\r\n- Easy sharing and collaboration\r\n- Gallery integration\r\n\r\n**Fast Processing:**\r\n- Minutes, not hours (30-60 seconds per render)\r\n- Consistent results across projects\r\n- Professional quality outputs\r\n- Easy to use—no complex software\r\n\r\n## AEC Use Cases\r\n\r\n### Architecture\r\n\r\n- **Building renders**: Exterior and interior visualizations\r\n- **Site visualizations**: Context-aware site renders\r\n- **Planning presentations**: Professional presentation materials\r\n- **Client materials**: Client-ready visuals\r\n- **Design exploration**: Fast concept development\r\n\r\n### Engineering\r\n\r\n- **Infrastructure visualization**: Bridges, roads, utilities\r\n- **Technical documentation**: Enhanced technical drawings\r\n- **Presentation materials**: Professional engineering visuals\r\n- **Project communication**: Clear visual communication\r\n\r\n### Construction\r\n\r\n- **Pre-construction visualization**: Show future results\r\n- **Progress documentation**: Visualize construction phases\r\n- **Client communication**: Clear progress updates\r\n- **Marketing materials**: Project promotion visuals\r\n\r\n## Retail Use Cases\r\n\r\n### Store Design\r\n\r\n- **Layout visualization**: See store arrangements before implementation\r\n- **Merchandising displays**: Visualize product placement\r\n- **Brand consistency**: Maintain visual identity across locations\r\n- **Customer experience**: Plan customer flow and experience\r\n\r\n### E-Commerce\r\n\r\n- **Product environments**: Create lifestyle product scenes\r\n- **Marketing visuals**: Generate promotional

Shortcuts**: Enter to submit, Esc to close modals\n5. **Deep Links**: Share project URLs using slugs\n\n## URL Structure\n\nRenderiq uses clean, SEO-friendly URLs:\n\n- **Projects**: `/dashboard/projects/[slug]` (not ID)\n- **Chains**: `/dashboard/projects/[slug]/chain/[chainId]`\n- **Canvas**: `/canvas/[projectSlug]/[chatId]`\n- **Public**: `/gallery`, `/pricing`, `/use-cases`\n\n## Next Steps\n\n- [Creating Your First Project](/docs/creating-your-first-project) - Start creating\n- [Creating Your First Chain](/docs/creating-your-first-chain) - Organize renders\n- [Unified Chat Interface](/docs/unified-chat-interface) - Master rendering\n\n## SEO Keywords\n\nRenderiq routes, dashboard pages, project management, rendering interface, canvas editor, API endpoints, navigation guide, app structure, page overview\n",

They organize related renders into sequences, allowing you to track design evolution and reference previous versions. This guide covers everything about creating and managing render chains.\n\n## What is a Render Chain?\n\nA render chain is a collection of renders organized in sequential order. Each chain:\n\n- **Groups Related Renders**: Keeps related iterations together\n- **Maintains Version History**: Tracks render sequence and order\n- **Enables References**: Allows referencing previous renders in new generations\n- **Tracks Iteration Progress**: Shows how designs evolve over time\n- **Preserves Context**: Maintains context between related renders\n\n### Chain Structure\n\nEach chain includes:\n- **Chain ID**: Unique identifier (UUID)\n- **Project ID**: Parent project reference\n- **Name**: Descriptive chain name\n- **Description**: Optional chain description\n- **Renders**: Array of renders in sequence\n- **Chain Position**: Position of each render in sequence\n- **Timestamps**: Created and updated dates\n\n## Why Use Chains?\n\nChains are useful for:\n- **Iteration Tracking**: See how your design evolves\n- **Version Control**: Reference specific versions\n- **Context Preservation**: Maintain context between renders\n- **Organization**: Keep related work together\n\n## Creating a Chain\n\n### Method 1: Automatic Creation (Recommended)\n\nWhen you create your first render in a project, a default chain is automatically created:\n\n**Automatic Chain Creation Process**:\n1. User generates first render in a project\n2. System checks for existing chains in the project\n3. If no chains exist, creates a new default chain\n4. Chain name: `[Project Name] - Iterations`\n5. Description: \"Automatic chain for render iterations\"\n6. Render is added to the chain at position 0\n\n**Benefits**:\n- No manual setup required\n- Consistent naming convention\n- Automatic organization\n- Seamless workflow\n\n### Method 2: Manual Creation via API\n\nChains can be created manually using the `createRenderChain` server action:\n\n```typescript\nconst result = await createRenderChain(\n  projectId,\n  'My Custom Chain',\n  'Description of the chain'\n);\n```\n\n**Use Cases**:\n- Creating multiple chains for different design directions\n- Organizing renders by client or phase\n- Separating experimental from production renders\n\n### Method 3: From Render Page\n\n1. Navigate to `/render`\n2. Select your project from the dropdown\n3. **Automatic**: If no chain exists, one is created automatically\n4. **Manual Selection**: Select an existing chain from the chain dropdown\n5. Generate render (it will be added to selected chain)\n\n## Managing Chains\n\n### Viewing Chains\n\nView all chains in a project:\n1. Go to project detail page\n2. Navigate to the \"Chains\" section\n3. See all chains with render counts\n\n### Chain Details\n\nEach chain shows:\n- Chain name and description\n- Number of renders\n- Creation date\n- Last updated date\n- Render previews\n\n### Editing Chains\n\n1. Go to chain detail page\n2. Click \"Edit Chain\"\n3. Update name or description\n4. Save changes\n\n### Deleting Chains\n\n1. Go to chain detail page\n2. Click \"Delete Chain\"\n3. Confirm deletion\n\n**Warning**: Deleting a chain will not delete the renders, but they will be removed from the chain.\n\n## Adding Renders to Chains\n\n### Automatic Addition\n\nWhen generating a render:\n- If a chain is selected, the render is automatically added\n- Renders are added in sequence\n- Each render gets a position number\n\n### Manual Addition\n\n1. Go to render detail page\n2. Click \"Add to Chain\"\n3. Select the chain\n4. Choose position (optional)\n\n## Chain Navigation\n\n### Viewing Chain Renders\n\n1. Navigate to chain detail page\n2. See all renders in sequence\n3. Click any render to view details\n4. Use navigation arrows to move between renders\n\n### Chain Position\n\nEach render in a chain has a position:\n- Position 0: First render\n- Position 1: Second render\n- And so on...\n\nPositions help maintain order and allow referencing by position.\n\n## Referencing Previous Renders\n\n### Using Mentions\n\nIn the unified chat interface, you can reference previous renders:\n- Use `@v1` to reference the first render\n- Use `@v2` to reference the second render\n- Use `@latest` to reference the most recent render\n\n### Visual References\n\nWhen creating a new render:\n- Previous renders in the chain are shown\n- Click to use as reference\n- Reference render appears in the prompt\n\n## Chain Best Practices\n\n### Naming Conventions\n\n- Use descriptive names: \"Exterior Design Iterations\"\n- Include version info: \"Kitchen Design v2\"\n- Use consistent naming across projects\n\n### Organization\n\n- One chain per design direction\n- Create new chains for major changes\n- Archive completed chains\n\n### Documentation\n\n- Add descriptions to chains\n- Use render notes to document changes\n- Keep track of what worked and what didn't\n\n## Advanced Features\n\n### Chain Branching\n\nCreate variations by:\n1. Selecting a render as starting point\n2. Creating a new chain\n3. Adding the selected render as first render\n4. Building from there\n\n### Chain Merging\n\nCurrently not available, but you can:\n- Manually add renders from one chain to another\n- Reference renders across chains\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n### Can't Create Chain\n\n- Ensure you have a project selected\n- Check if you have permission\n- Verify project isn't archived\n\n### Renders Not Appearing in Chain\n\n- Check if render was added to chain\n- Verify you're viewing the correct chain\n- Refresh the page\n\n### Chain Not Updating\n\n- Refresh the page\n- Check if render generation completed\n- Verify chain selection\n\n## Next Steps\n\n- [Unified Chat Interface](/docs/unified-chat-interface) - Learn how to generate renders\n- [Prompt Engineering](/docs/prompt-engineering) - Master the art of prompts\n\n",

This guide will teach you how to craft prompts that produce the renders you envision.\r\n\r\n## Understanding Prompts\r\n\r\nA prompt is a text description that tells the AI what to generate. The better your prompt, the better your results.\r\n\r\n### What Makes a Good Prompt?\r\n\r\n1. **Specificity**: Clear and detailed descriptions\r\n2. **Structure**: Organized information\r\n3. **Context**: Relevant background information\r\n4. **Style**: Consistent style references\r\n5. **Constraints**: What to include/exclude\r\n\r\n## Prompt Structure\r\n\r\n### Basic Structure\r\n\r\n```\r\n[Subject] + [Style] + [Details] + [Environment] + [Quality Indicators]\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Example\r\n\r\n```\r\nModern minimalist house with floor-to-ceiling windows, Scandinavian style, \r\nwhite walls and natural wood accents, surrounded by pine trees, \r\nsunny day with soft shadows, photorealistic, high detail, \r\narchitectural photography style\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Key Components\r\n\r\n### 1. Subject\r\n\r\nClearly describe what you're creating:\r\n- **Building Type**: House, office, restaurant, etc.\r\n- **Architectural Style**: Modern, traditional, contemporary, etc.\r\n- **Key Features**: Windows, materials, layout, etc.\r\n\r\n**Good Examples:**\r\n- \"Contemporary glass office building\"\r\n- \"Traditional Japanese tea house\"\r\n- \"Modernist concrete apartment complex\"\r\n\r\n**Poor Examples:**\r\n- \"Building\"\r\n- \"Nice house\"\r\n- \"Architecture\"\r\n\r\n### 2. Style\r\n\r\nSpecify the visual style:\r\n- **Architectural Style**: Modern, Art Deco, Brutalist, etc.\r\n- **Rendering Style**: Photorealistic, sketch, wireframe, etc.\r\n- **Artistic Style**: Minimalist, ornate, industrial, etc.\r\n\r\n**Examples:**\r\n- \"Brutalist concrete architecture\"\r\n- \"Art Nouveau decorative style\"\r\n- \"Minimalist Scandinavian design\"\r\n\r\n### 3. Materials and Textures\r\n\r\nDescribe materials explicitly:\r\n- **Exterior**: Concrete, glass, wood, metal, stone\r\n- **Interior**: Marble, hardwood, fabric, leather\r\n- **Textures**: Smooth, rough, polished, weathered\r\n\r\n**Examples:**\r\n- \"Weathered cedar wood siding\"\r\n- \"Polished marble floors\"\r\n- \"Raw concrete walls with formwork texture\"\r\n\r\n### 4. Environment and Context\r\n\r\nSet the scene:\r\n- **Location**: Urban, rural, coastal, mountain\r\n- **Surroundings**: Trees, water, other buildings\r\n- **Time of Day**: Morning, noon, sunset, night\r\n- **Weather**: Sunny, cloudy, rainy, foggy\r\n\r\n**Examples:**\r\n- \"Urban setting with city skyline in background\"\r\n- \"Coastal location with ocean view\"\r\n- \"Mountain setting surrounded by pine forests\"\r\n\r\n### 5. Lighting\r\n\r\nDescribe lighting conditions:\r\n- **Natural Light**: Direct sun, diffused, golden hour\r\n- **Artificial Light**: Warm, cool, accent lighting\r\n- **Shadows**: Soft, hard, dramatic\r\n- **Atmosphere**: Bright, moody, ethereal\r\n\r\n**Examples:**\r\n- \"Golden hour sunlight casting long shadows\"\r\n- \"Soft diffused daylight through large windows\"\r\n- \"Dramatic evening lighting with warm interior glow\"\r\n\r\n### 6. Composition and Perspective\r\n\r\nGuide the camera/view:\r\n- **Angle**: Aerial, eye-level, low angle\r\n- **Distance**: Close-up, medium, wide shot\r\n- **Focus**: Foreground, background, specific elements\r\n\r\n**Examples:**\r\n- \"Aerial view from above\"\r\n- \"Eye-level perspective from street\"\r\n- \"Close-up of entrance detail\"\r\n\r\n## Advanced Techniques\r\n\r\n### Negative Prompts\r\n\r\nSpecify what to avoid:\r\n- \"No people, no vehicles, no text\"\r\n- \"Avoid cluttered backgrounds\"\r\n- \"No visible power lines or signs\"\r\n\r\n### Style References\r\n\r\nReference specific styles or architects:\r\n- \"In the style of Frank Lloyd Wright\"\r\n- \"Bauhaus-inspired design\"\r\n- \"Japanese minimalist aesthetic\"\r\n\r\n### Technical Details\r\n\r\nInclude architectural specifics:\r\n- \"Cantilevered structure\"\r\n- \"Post-and-beam construction\"\r\n- \"Curtain wall facade system\"\r\n\r\n### Mood and Atmosphere\r\n\r\nConvey feeling:\r\n- \"Serene and peaceful\"\r\n- \"Dynamic and energetic\"\r\n- \"Luxurious and opulent\"\r\n- \"Industrial and raw\"\r\n\r\n## Prompt Templates\r\n\r\n### Exterior Architecture\r\n\r\n```\r\n[Building Type] in [Architectural Style], \r\n[Key Materials], [Notable Features], \r\nlocated in [Environment], \r\n[Time of Day] with [Lighting], \r\n[Perspective], [Style], [Quality]\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Interior Design\r\n\r\n```\r\n[Room Type] with [Style] design, \r\n[Key Materials and Colors], \r\n[Furniture and Layout], \r\n[Lighting Conditions], \r\n[View/Windows], [Mood], [Quality]\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Landscape Architecture\r\n\r\n```\r\n[Space Type] featuring [Elements], \r\n[Materials and Plants], \r\n[Layout and Flow], \r\n[Surrounding Context], \r\n[Time of Day], [Season], [Quality]\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Common Mistakes\r\n\r\n### Too Vague\r\n❌ \"Nice building\"\r\n✅ \"Modern glass office building with geometric facade\"\r\n\r\n### Too Complex\r\n❌ \"A building with everything\"\r\n✅ Focus on key elements\r\n\r\n### Missing Context\r\n❌ \"House\"\r\n✅ \"Contemporary single-family house in suburban setting\"\r\n\r\n### Inconsistent Style\r\n❌ Mixing multiple conflicting styles\r\n✅ Choose one style and be consistent\r\n\r\n### Ignoring Environment\r\n❌ \"Building\" (no context)\r\n✅ \"Building in urban setting with surrounding architecture\"\r\n\r\n## Iterative Refinement\r\n\r\n### Start Broad\r\nBegin with general concept:\r\n\"Modern house\"\r\n\r\n### Add Details\r\nRefine with specifics:\r\n\"Modern minimalist house with large windows and flat roof\"\r\n\r\n### Include Context\r\nAdd environment:\r\n\"Modern minimalist house with large windows and flat roof, \r\nsurrounded by mature trees, sunny day\"\r\n\r\n### Specify Style\r\nAdd rendering style:\r\n\"Modern minimalist house with large windows and flat roof, \r\nsurrounded by mature trees, sunny day, \r\nphotorealistic architectural photography\"\r\n\r\n## Using References\r\n\r\n### Image References\r\n- Upload clear reference images\r\n- Describe what you want from the reference\r\n- Combine multiple references\r\n- Use as style guide, not exact copy\r\n\r\n### Previous Renders\r\n- Reference successful renders\r\n- Build on what worked\r\n- Use version mentions (@v1, @latest)\r\n- Iterate on concepts\r\n\r\n## Style-Specific Tips\r\n\r\n### Photorealistic\r\n- Include lighting details\r\n- Specify camera settings\r\n- Mention photography style\r\n- Add realistic details\r\n\r\n### Sketch/Illustration\r\n- Mention drawing style\r\n- Specify line weight\r\n- Include artistic medium\r\n- Add texture details\r\n\r\n### Wireframe\r\n- Focus on structure\r\n- Mention line style\r\n- Include technical details\r\n- Specify view angle\r\n\r\n## Quality Indicators\r\n\r\nAdd quality hints:\r\n- \"High detail\"\r\n- \"Sharp focus\"\r\n- \"Professional photography\"\r\n- \"Architectural rendering quality\"\r\n- \"4K resolution detail\"\r\n\r\n## Examples\r\n\r\n### Good Prompt Example 1\r\n\r\n```\r\nContemporary glass and steel office building, \r\nminimalist design with clean lines, \r\ncurtain wall facade with bronze tinted glass, \r\nlocated in downtown urban setting, \r\nlate afternoon golden hour lighting, \r\naerial perspective, \r\nphotorealistic architectural photography, \r\nhigh detail, professional rendering\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Good Prompt Example 2\r\n\r\n```\r\nScandinavian-style single-family house, \r\nwhite painted wood siding with black window frames, \r\npitched roof with dark shingles, \r\nsurrounded by birch trees and wildflowers, \r\nsoft morning light with gentle shadows, \r\neye-level street view, \r\nphotorealistic, \r\nwarm and inviting atmosphere\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Good Prompt Example 3\r\n\r\n```\r\nBrutalist concrete apartment complex, \r\nraw concrete with visible formwork texture, \r\ngeometric shapes and sharp angles, \r\nurban setting with other buildings visible, \r\novercast day with diffused lighting, \r\nwide-angle perspective, \r\nphotorealistic, \r\ndramatic and imposing presence\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Practice Tips\r\n\r\n1. **Start Simple**: Begin with basic prompts\r\n2. **Iterate**: Refine based on results\r\n3. **Experiment**: Try different approaches\r\n4. **Learn from Results**: See what works\r\n5. **Build Library**: Save successful prompts\r\n\r\n## Next Steps\r\n\r\n- [Unified Chat Interface](/docs/unified-chat-interface) - Use prompts in the interface\r\n- [Creating Your First Project](/docs/creating-your-first-project) -
